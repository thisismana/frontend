had a softer side","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Rod Taylor, who has died aged 84, was a movie star of some magnitude who never achieved superstar status. He co-starred with Doris Day (twice), Jane Fonda, Rock Hudson and John Wayne; had leading roles in films by directors such as Alfred Hitchcock (The Birds, 1963) and Michelangelo Antonioni (Zabriskie Point, 1970); and starred in the perennially popular science-fiction classic The Time Machine (1960). Yet, at the height of Taylor’s career, 20th Century Fox turned him down for the astronaut role in Planet of the Apes (1968), giving it to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/07/obituaries.usa\" title=\"\">Charlton Heston</a>, because they considered him a bigger box-office name.</p> <p>Perhaps Taylor, handsome and with the build of a rugby forward, missed top billing because he was rarely able to demonstrate his flair for playing light comedy, having been too frequently called upon to be stolid and macho – traits that nevertheless made him an ideal action hero in war films and westerns.</p> <p>He was born in Sydney, Australia, the only child of William Sturt Taylor, a steel construction contractor, and his wife, Mona (nee Thompson), a writer. The name Sturt came from a celebrated forebear, Captain Charles Sturt, a British explorer of the Australian outback in the 19th century. Taylor would make his film debut in a short called Inland With Sturt (1951) about his ancestor.</p> <p>Taylor attended Parramatta high school in Sydney and studied at East Sydney Technical College before deciding to become an actor on seeing Laurence Olivier in the Old Vic touring company in Australia in 1948. His acting career in his homeland was focused on radio, though he did make two feature films, King of the Coral Sea (1953) and Long John Silver (1954), the latter with Robert Newton doing his famous rolling-eyed interpretation of the title role for the third and last time. Taylor later made an imitation of Newton one of his party pieces.</p> <p>In 1954, Taylor won an award as best Australian radio actor, which included a paid trip to London via Los Angeles. He stayed in LA with the hope of making it in Hollywood movies. Almost immediately, he got small parts in The Virgin Queen, Hell on Frisco Bay and Top Gun (all in 1955) and a lead in World Without End (1956). The last of these was a rather tacky, loose version of HG Wells’s The Time Machine, with Taylor as a stalwart astronaut entering a time warp – a good rehearsal for his role in the more faithful adaptation four years later.</p> <p>In 1956, he was screen-tested for the part of the boxer Rocky Graziano in MGM’s Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), after James Dean, who was to have starred, was killed in a car crash. Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/27/paulnewman.usa1\" title=\"\">Paul Newman</a> got the role, Taylor impressed the studio enough for them to offer him a significant part in The Catered Affair (aka Wedding Breakfast, 1956) in which, occasionally wearing glasses as a signifier of intellect, he played Ralph, the middle-class fiance of working-class Jane (Debbie Reynolds). “The Brooklyn accent I put on during the test so convinced the producers that I was from New York that they cast me as a Bronx boy. They didn’t know I was just 18 months out of Australia until the movie was half finished,” he said.</p> <p>In the same year, in Giant, he had a small role as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/23/elizabeth-taylor-obituary\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor</a>’s aristocratic English suitor, whom she throws over for a Texas millionaire (Rock Hudson). The two Taylors were together again in Raintree County (1957), she as a southern belle, he as a sleazy politician, the bete noire of a sensitive abolitionist (Montgomery Clift). In Separate Tables (1958), he and Audrey Dalton, as a young honeymoon couple, were closer to the subtle merits of Terence Rattigan’s original stage opus than the rest of the starry cast that included Burt Lancaster, David Niven, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/18/obituaries.news\" title=\"\">Deborah Kerr</a> and Rita Hayworth as guests at a genteel English seaside guesthouse.</p> <p>Ask Any Girl (1959) gave Taylor, though no Cary Grant, one of his few opportunities to play in a romantic comedy, which he did ably. Here he is delightfully caddish as a businessman who attempts to seduce naive Shirley MacLaine by taking her up to his aunt and uncle’s place in the country for the weekend, and forgetting to tell her they will be alone.</p> <p>Among his other rare comedies were Sunday in New York (1963), in which the tables are turned when Fonda tries to get him into bed; and two lightweight Day vehicles, Do Not Disturb (1965), in which she pretends to make her husband (Taylor) jealous because she thinks he’s having an affair, and The Glass Bottom Boat (1966), a spy spoof with Taylor as a research scientist who literally hooks Day while she’s swimming in a mermaid suit.</p> <p>By then Taylor had established himself as a reliable tough-guy leading man in films such as A Gathering of Eagles (1963) and Fate is the Hunter (1964), in both of which he played pilots. He portrayed one of his rare Australian characters, a self-made industrialist secretly adored by his mousy secretary (Maggie Smith) in the jet-set entertainment The VIPs (1963).</p> <p>However, his role as George Wells, a Victorian inventor, in George Pal’s The Time Machine was among his most memorable and a personal favourite. The film, which won an Oscar for its special effects, follows the valiant, square-jawed Taylor into the horrors of the future, through two world wars and atomic destruction (in 1966), stopping in the year 802,701, when he helps defeat the hideous, underground-dwelling Morlocks. Three years after The Time Machine, Taylor found himself manfully fighting off a swarm of crazed gulls, crows, sparrows, and more in The Birds, after attempting to melt the heart of a young socialite (Tippi Hedren).</p> <p>Taylor did not seem ideal to play the Irish playwright Sean O’Casey in Young Cassidy (1965), but in it he gave perhaps his best performance, skilfully combining strength and sensitivity. But from 1967 onwards Taylor honed his persona as an action man, with archetypal performances as a hardened professional gunfighter in Chuka (1967), which he also produced; the ruthless army captain sorting out the civil war in the Congo in The Mercenaries (aka Dark of the Sun, 1968); a laid-back gunslinger hired by Wayne in The Train Robbers (1973); and two “heavies”, a sneering cold-blooded killer in The Deadly Trackers (1973) and a wicked entrepreneur at the beginning of the 20th century in Australia in The Picture Show Man (1977). Antonioni wanted Taylor for the nasty capitalist in Zabriskie Point precisely because he could be aloof and steely.</p> <p>In the 1980s, though he was seen frequently on television, including a 30-episode stint in the soap opera Falcon Crest (1988-90) as Frank Agretti, the long-suffering third husband of Angela Channing (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/11/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">Jane Wyman</a>), the tyrannical owner of the eponymous wine-making estate, Taylor went into semi-retirement. “Pretending to still be the tough man of action isn’t dignified for me any more,” he told an interviewer in 1987. “There comes a time when you’re over the hill and there are plenty of great-looking younger actors who can take your place. The younger they come, the better they get. That’s why Olympic records are broken.”</p> <p>Quentin Tarantino, a long-time fan of the actor, gave Taylor the cameo role of Winston Churchill in Inglourious Basterds (2009).</p> <p>Taylor is survived by his third wife, Carol, and a daughter, Felicia, from his second marriage.</p> <p><em>• </em>Rodney Sturt Taylor, actor, born 11 January 1930; died 7 January 2015</p>","headline":"Rod Taylor obituary","trailText":"Film actor who excelled in tough-guy roles but had a softer side","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44mb7","wordcount":"1244","commentable":"true","byline":"Ronald Bergan","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T12:48:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/rod-taylor","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jan/09/rod-taylor","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","webTitle":"Australia news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/australia-news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ronaldbergan","webTitle":"Ronald Bergan","r2ContributorId":"25523","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/10/ronald_bergan_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"bergan","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ronaldbergan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ronaldbergan","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"302abb4aa11f5dd7f9cbca0f1c940f87b55ba16b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/9/1420808127754/rod-taylor-obituary-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/9/1420808127754/rod-taylor-obituary-001.jpg","source":"Rex","photographer":"Snap","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"rod taylor obituary","suppliersReference":"390900hc","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Snap/Rex","caption":"Rod Taylor with Tippi Hedren and Jessica Tandy in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963).

This fleeting glory, though, is the beginning of the end. Over the next two hours, Bennett Miller’s film dismantles the American dream, dragging Mark and Dave Schultz into a pit of disillusionment, exploitation and, ultimately, murder. </p> <p>It begins in 1984, when John du Pont (played by Steve Carell), a patriotic wrestling fan and 45-year-old heir to an obscene family fortune, invites Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) to his Pennsylvania estate. There he outlines a grand plan: he will bankroll Schultz, who in turn will form and coach a team for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Despite his Olympic triumph, Schultz is out of work and needs funding, so off he goes to Pennsylvania, where things slowly unravel as Du Pont’s twisted ego spirals into mental illness. Later, Mark’s brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), is also invited to coach the team, but Du Pont’s reverence for him turns to resentment. The whole toxic mess ends, in 1996, with Du Pont killing Dave Schultz.</p> <p>This is all perfect material for Miller, who thrives on psychological exploration. His first film, 1998 documentary The Cruise, affectionately scrutinised kooky New York tour guide Timothy Levitch; he followed it with 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/feb/26/philipfrench\">Capote</a>, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman a stack of awards. Drawn to the Foxcatcher story as soon as he found it in 2006, Miller began work, but false starts led him to postpone it and make Moneyball instead. He never stopped working on Foxcatcher, though, undergoing a multitude of interviews and constantly developing the script with co-writers in an attempt to try to understand what the hell went on with Du Pont and the wrestling brothers.</p> <p>Foxcatcher is an eerie experience, its constant gloom speaking volumes about its main players’ states of mind. Miller spent much time with Mark Schultz, uncovering layers over the years. “Mark was eager to get his story out [on film] and was writing his autobiography,” says Miller of their initial meetings. “But what he had written was very adolescent and bitter. It was one long axe-grinding rant, clearly distorted to serve his agenda.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PypvNBTdxnY\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PypvNBTdxnY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Revenge? “Yeah, just vengeful and revisionist. He’s a very personable guy now, and can be charming. But I began to challenge some of his assertions and he never fought too much about it. He would have tantrums every so often. I raised the issue of cocaine being used, and he denied it at first, so I said, ‘Mark, literally everybody told me that there was a bunch of coke down there and that you and John did a lot of coke together.’ And he was like, ‘It’s true, it’s true, but… You can’t say that!’ I said, ‘Mark, I’m gonna either make a film that’s obedient to nothing other than my instincts about what the film should be or I’m not gonna make the film.’ And, to be fair, he responds well to that kind of forthcoming openness, and he signed off. It was then six years before we started shooting, and that turned out to be some benefit, because it was a long process of opening his hand and getting him to share.”</p> <p>Miller is a meticulous, investigative film-maker. On the Foxcatcher set he came armed with various screenplay drafts, and would also constantly rework ideas with the actors. At times, he would go out of his way to make them uncomfortable, pitting them against one another to create tension and raw performances; in return, they pushed themselves even further. In the flesh, Miller makes for easy company, brimming with confidence and a justified authority. We speak at length about his views on Du Pont and paranoid schizophrenia, and when our time is up, he laments the fact that we can’t keep discussing it. Du Pont always denied killing Dave Schultz, despite having done so in view of Dave’s wife, Nancy. The jury found him guilty but mentally ill, and he was jailed for the murder. He died in prison in 2010.</p> <p>Some have blamed those around Du Pont for not doing enough as his mental state deteriorated, especially those who were on the payroll. Some of the wrestlers agree, blaming themselves for turning a blind eye to his behaviour. The corruptive power of money is the dark heart of the film, and it has universal ripples. Financial subservience is, of course, rampant in Hollywood but Miller has enjoyed creative control throughout his career, never selling out for the studio dime. Still, he’s acutely aware of how easy it can be to fall into those traps and works hard to avoid them. Did that further draw him to the story?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf611d6f0263b2879b56aae316e2f86acf680e4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420722249640/25676f03-f57f-450e-aa79-3b97a60b97b8-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bennett Miller\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bennett Miller</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Yeah, for the personal reasons you’ve just illuminated. And even if I feel satisfied with the measure of control that I’ve been able to sustain, it hasn’t been without a struggle. There is a very uneasy relationship between money and creativity, between money and almost everything. Its tendency to control and corrupt – whether it’s in arts or education or politics, hardly anything is untouched by it. Journalism certainly is up there. Everything is susceptible to it. It’s not like I’ve managed to live a totally carefree, immunised existence. So [my interest is] from a personal level, yeah, but also just as a person living in a world that feels ever more challenged by the compromising effects of the competing interests. And it’s a necessary relationship. It’s a very fascinating transaction between Du Pont and these wrestlers. It is a transaction. What are they each getting, what do they want?”</p> <p>Recently, Miller and Schultz’s own transaction in making the film has been thrown under the microscope. When we spoke, Miller insisted that Schultz was satisfied with his portrayal by Tatum, flaws and vulnerabilities included. “Now it’s done, he’s more than at peace with what the film is. He gets extremely emotional watching it.” Yet after Christmas, Schultz dramatically U-turned. In response to critical interpretations of the film’s ambiguous hint of sexual undertones between himself and Du Pont, he let rip on Twitter, saying that the cinematic portrayal of him was grossly inaccurate, and that he hated the film and Miller. “I HATE EVERYTHING THAT SCUM TOUCHES. EVERYTHING!!!”, he concluded.</p> <p>On 3 January, though, Schultz was back on message, apologising on Facebook for his “hasty, emotionally charged reaction,” explaining that he has “been learning to understand the artistic and creative process which is [Miller’s] expertise”. Foxcatcher is, necessarily, just an interpretation – albeit an assiduously researched and considered one. All Bennett Miller is asking you to be aware of is the transactions: between patron and performer, between subject and writer and ultimately, between film-maker and viewer.</p> <p><em><strong>Foxcatcher is in cinemas now</strong></em></p>","headline":"Foxcatcher: the ‘uneasy relationship between money and creativity’","trailText":"Director Bennett Miller follows his American football film Moneyball with an altogether eerier exploration of the darker side of sporting triumph","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420721777717/fa9baa1f-d8e9-4918-887e-bb78d87baa53-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1121","commentable":"true","byline":"Alex Godfrey","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-16T14:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/foxcatcher-bennett-miller-steve-carell","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jan/09/foxcatcher-bennett-miller-steve-carell","tags":[{"id":"film/foxcatcher","webTitle":"Foxcatcher","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/foxcatcher","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/foxcatcher","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"film/stevecarell","webTitle":"Steve Carell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stevecarell","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/stevecarell","references":[]},{"id":"film/channing-tatum","webTitle":"Channing Tatum","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/channing-tatum","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/channing-tatum","references":[]},{"id":"film/mark-ruffalo","webTitle":"Mark Ruffalo","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-ruffalo","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mark-ruffalo","references":[]},{"id":"film/moneyball","webTitle":"Moneyball","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/moneyball","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/moneyball","references":[]},{"id":"film/philipseymourhoffman","webTitle":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/philipseymourhoffman","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/philipseymourhoffman","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alex-godfrey","webTitle":"Alex Godfrey","r2ContributorId":"45534","firstName":"alex","lastName":"godfrey","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-godfrey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alex-godfrey","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide","webTitle":"The Guide","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"408e9614cd93bb67c2c93473806d4fd572c2038e","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420722470999/41bcd2fd-a652-455b-9e49-1e6acac085c1-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"'© Fair Hill, LLC.

In Ridley Scott’s 1997 film, shaven-headed Demi Moore - 35 at the time - starred as Lieutenant Jordan O’Neill, the first woman to join the elite Navy Seals. Moore trained with a special forces instructor for the role and became convincingly ripped. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhsvgx3B7c0\">In a punishing workout scene</a>, dogtag rattling and torso glistening in the moonlight, she busts out sit-ups and pull-ups in increasingly impossible positions, before performing one-armed press-ups with apparent ease.

The “condom full of walnuts” competed with the era’s other big bodybuilding icon, 6ft 5in Lou “Incredible Hulk” Ferrigno, for the title of Mr Olympia 1975. The pair had contrasting styles: shy, partially deaf Ferrigno trained with his father in a basement gym, while Arnie worked out at Muscle Beach surrounded by hangers-on and waged psychological warfare on his rivals.

John Travolta starred as the reporter dispatched to write a story that would be headlined “More sex than sweat”, revealing how “fitness clubs are the new singles bars”. At the Sport Connection gym, he meets aerobics instructor Jamie Lee Curtis and a romance develops that compromises his story.

L is for luvvies and other insults…</strong></p> <p>Let’s be cheerful about all this, and keep a sense of humour when a journalist (as one recently did) describes the stage as a place where “luvvies strike their poses”.</p> <p>I suppose the “luv” in “luvvies” means we make real love into something as cheap as chips and just scatter it loosely around. But when I started out, theatre people often signed off a letter with “luv”, not “love”, because it was a matter of being precise about it. It was so that you, the recipient, didn’t get any ideas, and a rather puritanical definition of how you stood with the writer: this close and no more, friendly but no challenge to your real lover for instance. “Luv” was really a term of respect, and “love” a true admission. Nowadays men from all walks of life are always kissing in the street, and emails all end with at least one x: it makes the theatre seem almost restrained.</p> <p>Aktorrrrs: I can’t really account for the fact that some people can’t pronounce the actual word, as if it were somehow embarrassing. Is this some kind of English dismay? A compliment to your legendary diction, rolling rs as they should be rolled? Or because it would somehow be insulting to suggest that acting were a serious job with a proper name?</p> <p>“Turns” is at least accurate and brings us fraternally close to circus performers – and that’s fine by me.</p> <p>It’s odd, isn’t it? Lawyers also wear silly wigs and do their best with hopeless scripts they don’t believe in, using a technique they often seem to have learned off TV rather than the other way round. They too schmooze the judge and attack the other counsel before having a drink with him in the evening; but the public doesn’t seem to have trouble with them. And as for the doctors, I knew an eye surgeon who said, chillingly, that he liked going to the theatre because it reminded him of work in his theatre: you never quite know what’s going to happen. But we don’t call doctors doctorrrrs or lawyers barrristas.</p> <p>The truth is the public only really likes actors if they’re national treasures. Then a whole different, and deferential, vocabulary comes in. Even then, the thing to remember is they’re probably never going to love you, not really. Tonight I’ve been watching The Review Show on TV: an American academic professed herself “put off” by all the praise for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/lincoln-review\">Daniel Day-Lewis’s portrayal of Abraham Lincoln</a> before she saw it. She said she was afraid it had been oversold and she was in for something “thespy”, something “scenery-chewing” – and was pleasantly surprised. Why would she be surprised? She then purred with an unmistakable kind of fervour that she now thinks Day-Lewis is a complete genius: “It’s the best screen performance of our lifetimes…”</p> <p>But why would she have expected anything else?</p> <p><em>Let Me Play the Lion Too: How To Be an Actor by Michael Pennington is published on 15 January by Faber &amp; Faber and is <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/let-me-play-the-lion-too.html\">available from the Guardian Bookshop</a>.

taking charge of the cameras.</p> <p>Producer Marc Platt, who was also behind the stage version, confirmed <a href=\"http://www.filmdivider.com/7958/wicked-producer-marc-platt-gives-an-update-on-progress-and-that-2016-release-date/\">in an interview with Film Divider</a> that work on developing the movie had

Daldry, who <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2012/07/comic-con-2012-wicked-musical-wizard-of-oz-prequel-jersey-boys-movie-universalbroadway-299442/\">studio Universal has been courting since at least 2012</a>, remains attached to the project.</p> <p>Platt said a 2016 release is the aim, “but I don’t know whether we’ll make that goal or not. We will make the movie, but … the bar is really high. We’re going to scrutinise our work on the screenplay and our prep on the movie, and when we feel like it’s ready, OK. We’re not going to shoot a release date is what I’m saying. It’s in the works, it’s not in a rush.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/jan/07/into-the-woods-anna-kendrick-james-cordon-video-interview\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/44kph\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2219768\"                data-video-name=\"Into The Woods star Anna Kendrick: 'The woods are like a sexy night club' - video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/1/7/1420650858025/crop_KP-64136_640.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-454324407\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/1/7/1420650854616/crop_KP-64136_1200.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/01/07/150107IntoTheWoods_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/01/07/150107IntoTheWoods_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/01/07/150107IntoTheWoods_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/01/07/150107IntoTheWoods.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/01/07/150107IntoTheWoods_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Anna Kendrick and James Corden on Into the Woods</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Platt, producer of current witchy stage-to-screen adaptation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/into-the-woods\">Into the Woods</a>, said it had taken 27 years to bring Stephen Sondheim’s fairytale fable to the big screen, adding: “Some things take time for a reason.”</p> <p>Wicked, based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, is an alternative telling of the 1939 film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wizard-of-oz\">The Wizard of Oz</a> and its source novel, L Frank Baum’s 1900 book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It examines the story of Oz from the perspective of witches Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda the Good Witch.</p> <p>Speculation over the film version’s release was sparked when UK cinema chain Vue listed Wicked as a 2016 release. “Our [stage] show is still so strong everywhere,” said Platt, “and we just set a record in both London and Edinburgh last week, and in Los Angeles, and we did [the same] on Broadway. Audiences enjoy that show so much that we are intending to move forward on the movie, but aren’t going to do so until we’re satisfied in the material we have as a screenplay, and that the film will be every bit as satisfying as what we have on the stage.”</p> <p>Wicked would be the second riff on The Wizard of Oz to arrive on the big screen in recent years, following Disney prequel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oz-the-great-and-powerful\">Oz the Great and Powerful</a> in 2013. Sam Raimi’s film was a box-office success, grossing $493m worldwide, despite lukewarm reviews.</p>","headline":"Stephen Daldry to work his directorial magic on Wicked film","trailText":"British

with jokes about tin-pot dictators, the Marx Brothers’ 1933 film Duck Soup resonates with the politics of the time, but it’s the wonderful non-stop puns that drive this classic comedy","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>A pun is a word that doesn’t mean what it says, or rather, means what it says but also means something else. It is a signpost bearing the same destination, but pointing in two directions.</p> <p>The longest pun-free period in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/duck-soup\"><em>Duck Soup</em></a> is at the beginning, after the unsettling opening shot of ducks paddling in a cauldron over a hot fire. We are in the majestic council chamber of the government of Freedonia. A meeting is in session. Zander, the president, is asking the wealthy Mrs Gloria Teasdale, widow of the late Chester V Teasdale, for a further $20m, so that he can announce an immediate reduction in taxes. Mrs Teasdale, played by the redoubtable Margaret Dumont, complains that she has already donated half her fortune, and will only lend more money if a new leader is put in place.</p> <p>It is already a minute in, and there is still no pun in sight. Instead, the language of negotiation fills the air: this could be any political film, at any time, dealing with the usual problems of borrowing, taxing and spending. You almost feel that, if you looked very hard, you could spot George Osborne or Vince Cable in the background, beavering away.</p> <p>“In a crisis like this, I feel Freedonia needs a new leader,” declares Mrs Teasdale. “A progressive, fearless fighter, a man like … Rufus T Firefly!”</p> <p>Firefly is, of course, Groucho Marx, but we have still not had a glimpse of him. Instead, the scene switches to an absurdly lavish ballroom, its vast staircase flanked by overly plumed guards and trumpeters with exceedingly long trumpets. It is the reception for His Excellency Rufus T Firefly, who has yet to arrive. After various formal introductions, a troupe of ballerinas enters, scattering flowers along his projected walkway. Everyone choruses:</p> <blockquote> <p>His Excellency is due</p> <p>To take his station,</p> <p>Beginning his new administration</p> <p>He’ll make his appearance when</p> <p>The clock on the wall strikes 10!</p> <p>We’ll give him a rousing cheer</p> <p>To show him we’re glad he’s here!</p> <p>Hail, hail Freedonia!</p> <p>Land of the brave and free!</p> </blockquote> <p>In 1933, when <em>Duck Soup</em> was first released, this deadbeat song with its patriotic lyrics would have brought to mind the forced jubilations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joseph-stalin\">Stalin</a>’s Soviet Union or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/adolf-hitler\">Hitler</a>’s Germany; even today, it remains the prototypical song for countries such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/azerbaijan\">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a>, speaking of order and shared purpose, of a population pointing in the same direction. And still no sign of a pun.</p> <p>The minutes tick by, and the ceremony keeps on stopping and starting as His Excellency fails to appear. All eyes are on the entrance when Groucho Marx finally lollops in from the side, unseen. Finally, he is greeted – “I welcome you with open arms” – by a clearly besotted Mrs Teasdale. The moment he enters, the puns come thick and punishingly fast, with no letup. The more Mrs Teasdale coos, the more he undermines her with his crazed wordplay. “You can leave in a taxi. If you can’t leave in a taxi you can leave in a huff. If that’s too soon, you can leave in a minute and a huff.” These quick-fire speeches have a topsy-turvy logic all their own, each word changing its meaning the moment it is uttered.</p> <p>Everything about Groucho was a pun. His father was called Simon, not Sam, and Marrix, not Marx; his mother’s real name was Miene Schönberg, but her stage name was Minnie Palmer. Groucho was born Julius; he only transformed into Groucho in a break between shows, when a fellow comedian allotted nicknames to each of the Marx Brothers: Milton wore rubber boots, hence Gummo; Leonard chased women, or “chicks”, hence Chico, and Adolph played the harp, hence Harpo. And as for Julius, he carried a small drawstring bag known as a “grouch”.</p> <p>Groucho’s most visible characteristic is itself a sort of pun. It is both a moustache, and not a moustache. Instead, it is a painting of a moustache – <em>ceci n’est pas une moustache</em> – that he first daubed on his face with greasepaint in 1921, having arrived late for a performance, with no time to glue on his artificial whiskers. Before long, his eyebrows followed suit. Between them, they were to become the great symbol of the Marx Brothers, loved by low-brows and high-brows alike.</p> <p>The world of Freedonia is a world built on order. Everything is where it should be and does what it is meant to, before the Marx Brothers send it all haywire. After their arrival, nothing is allowed to remain in its rightful place, or to be what it is meant to be. Everything is transformed into something else. The world has become a pun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CEdb0sGfaI\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CEdb0sGfaI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Amid much bugling, successive guards announce “His Excellency’s car!” But even the car is not a car: following another fanfare, Harpo appears on a motorcycle. “I’m in a hurry,” cries Groucho, stepping into the sidecar. “To the House of Representatives! Ride like fury. If you run out of gas, get ethyl. If Ethyl runs out, get Mabel. Now, step on it!” And with that, Harpo accelerates off, leaving the sidecar firmly in place. “Well, it certainly feels good to be back again,” says Groucho, having got nowhere.</p> <p>When Harpo next appears, he is with Chico. They arrive at the Ambassador’s door as his appointed spies, both wearing bearded masks and hats, with Harpo’s eyes whirling round on springs. But the mask itself is then unmasked: Chico turns Harpo round; his real face is on the other side of his head. The pair are double agents, or human puns.</p> <p>And so it goes on, order overturned, conformity unravelling, idiocy at the gates. Later – I was about to say much later, but the whole film lasts barely an hour and 10 minutes – we are in a courtroom, with the two spies on trialfor selling Freedonia’s secret war code and plans. “Sure. I sold a code and two pair of plans,” chips in Chico. Under the pressure of the courtroom, the puns bubble over, particularly when Chico turns turtle on the prosecutor:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Chico:</strong> Now, I ask you one. What is it has a trunk, but no key, weight 2,000lb and lives in a circus?</p> <p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> That’s irrelevant.</p> <p><strong>Chico:</strong> A relevant! Hey, that’s the answer. There’s a whole lotta relephants in a circus.</p> <p><strong>Judge:</strong> That sort of testimony we can eliminate.</p> <p><strong>Chico:</strong> ’At’s-a fine. I’ll take some.</p> <p><strong>Judge:</strong> You’ll take what?</p> <p><strong>Chico: </strong>Eliminate. A nice cold glass eliminate.</p> <p><strong>Firefly</strong>: Gentlemen, Chicolini here may talk like an idiot, and look like an idiot, but don’t let that fool you. He really is an idiot.</p> </blockquote> <p>One pun leads to another: they bounce with the speed and precision of a polished stone skimmed across a lake.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Minister of Finance:</strong> Something must be done! War would mean a prohibitive increase in our taxes!</p> <p><strong>Chico:</strong> Hey, I got an uncle lives in Taxes.</p> <p><strong>Minister of Finance:</strong> No. I’m talking about taxes – money, dollars.</p> <p><strong>Chico:</strong> Dollas! That’s where my uncle lives. Dollas, Taxes.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is the rat-a-tat-tat speed of their delivery that distinguishes the Marx Brothers from their contemporaries, and stops them growing old. Other comedies from that era now seem sluggish and laborious: <em>Duck Soup</em> is alive and kicking.</p> <p>Harpo, was, of course, the silent one, but the scenes in which he appears are generally far louder, and more perilous, than any of the others. He is a bundle of anarchic energy, targeting the pompous and the self-regarding, like all the vengeful characters in Struwwelpeter rolled into one. Always taking out his scissors and going snip-snip-snip, he snips off the ends of Chico’s frankfurter and Firefly’s quill pen, he snips off the peanut vendor’s apron, the ambassador’s tail coat and the soldiers’ fancy plumes. Instead of speaking, Harpo grins like a madman and honks his horn. Having broken into a house, he tries to open the safe, but he twists the volume dial of a radio by mistake. It starts to blare, so he has to smash it. Whenever he is on screen, even the most inanimate of objects cannot be trusted to stay quiet. At one point, he shows Groucho a tattoo on his stomach of a house. As Groucho takes a closer look at the tattoo, a dog pops out of it; when Groucho says “Miaow!” the dog starts barking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53a34a78277b3027bb4af3f9c016a14f764577b3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/6/1420564353577/f0ba9c21-bd92-4903-9db8-1ebe13a3fca3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Duck Soup\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Dumont and Groucho Marx in Duck Soup. Photograph: Courtesy Everett Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most celebrated scene, and the most sublime, revolves around another visual pun: a mirror that is not a mirror, a reflection that is not a reflection. Harpo, disguised as Groucho, tries to fool Groucho into believing that he is looking at himself in a mirror. Groucho, suspicious, executes a random series of increasingly ludicrous movements in the hope of catching him out. But whatever movement he makes, however daft, Harpo anticipates him and does just the same. Even when Groucho walks into what should be the mirror, and out the other side, Harpo does the same, but in reverse. Eighty years on, that visual gag is still going strong: in an episode of the gloriously perverse American cartoon series <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/family-guy\"><em>Family Guy</em></a>, the baby-man antihero Stewie is transported back to 1930s Berlin, where he disguises himself as Adolf Hitler. Then Hitler himself comes into the room, and Stewie has to convince him that he is looking into a mirror.</p> <p>The world in 1933 was becoming increasingly overpopulated with tin-pot dictators. Is <em>Duck Soup</em> a political satire? Many intellectuals and academics have argued as much, though they tend to belong to the school of criticism that likes to stamp all the jokes out of comedy so that they can praise its high seriousness without fear of contradiction. A New Yorker cartoon once showed a Professor of Semiotics saying “The tautology of their symbolism thus begins to achieve mythic proportions in <em>A Day at the Races</em>, <em>Duck Soup</em> and <em>A Night at the Opera</em>”. As is so often the case with New Yorker cartoons, it veers from reality only by a couple of degrees.</p> <p>Over the years, <em>Duck Soup</em> has been praised for its understanding of paranoia in international diplomacy and of the economics of warfare. It is full of gags about the futility of war and its financial advantages. At one point, Groucho is told of a peace plan and replies, “It’s too late, I’ve already paid a month’s rent on the battlefield.” At another, Groucho puts his hand on Harpo’s shoulder and tells him, in ringing tones, “You’re a brave man. Go and break through the lines. And remember, while you’re out there risking life and limb, through shot and shell, we’ll be in here thinking what a sucker you are.”</p> <p>This joke was echoed, 30 years later, in <em>Beyond the Fringe</em> (“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R_l9KbYpag\">I want you to lay down your life, Perkins</a>. We need a futile gesture at this stage”) but, taken as a whole, <em>Duck Soup</em> is too explosively nonsensical to let itself succumb to the discipline of satire, which might loosely be described as comedy with an agenda. (Nonsense is not an alternative version of sense, but rather its negation.)</p> <p>On 14 November 1933, three days before the release of <em>Duck Soup</em>, Harpo took a ship to the USSR, via Hamburg. He was to be the first American artist to perform in Moscow since the US, under President Roosevelt, had recognised the Soviet Union. Without realising it, he was about to enter a real-life looking-glass world, where draconian decisions are taken for all the wrong reasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"899a736c6996b3e64f176b1fbee57b11ba7ce59f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420726279713/ef96530b-1ee4-4bc1-b956-6034407bad53-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Photograph: Courtesy Everett Collection/Rex\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In his otherwise delightfully breezy autobiography <em>Harpo Speaks</em>, he says that in Hamburg he saw “the most frightening, most depressing sight I had ever seen – a row of stores with Stars of David and the word ‘Jude’ painted on them, and inside, behind half-empty counters, people in a daze, cringing like they didn’t know what hit them and didn’t know where the next blow would come from”.</p> <p>On the train out of Warsaw, he bumps into a fellow American, who tells him he’ll have to pay for excess baggage at the Russian border, and kindly lends him a hundred roubles, saying it will be cheaper to pay in roubles than dollars. But when Harpo offers roubles to the Inspector, mayhem ensues. “Bells rang. Buzzers sounded. Boots clomped all over the place as guards came running.”</p> <p>Harpo is hauled off to a shed, where he is cross-questioned. “Where did I get the rubles? A guy on the train lent them to me. What was his name? I didn’t know his name. I was lousy at remembering names. I was lying, the Russian colonel said. Tell the truth now: where did I get the rubles? I gave him the same answer.</p> <p>“A squad of guards lugged my trunk and harp into the shed. ‘Open the trunk, please,’ said the officer. I unlocked it and the Russians began unloading it. When at first they only found a raincoat and an assortment of pants, shirts and ties, they were obviously disappointed.</p> <p>“Then they hit the jackpot. From the trunk they removed 400 knives, two revolvers, three stilettos, half-a-dozen bottles marked POISON, and a collection of red wigs and false beards, moustaches and hands. More bells rang. More buzzers sounded. Whistles blew. More officials and more guards came clomping into the shed.”</p> <p>Harpo is grilled. “Would I please explain why I was transporting weapons and disguises? I told them they were all props for my act. Act? What act? I said I had come to Russia to put on a show. Americans do not entertain in Russia, they said. I had better tell the truth.”</p> <p>They ask what is in his harp case. A harp, he tells them. They order him to play something. “This would have been my salvation any other time, any other place, but in an open shed when it was 30 below zero. I was so stiff from the cold that I couldn’t get my gloves off. All I could do was run my gloved hands up the strings a couple of times and pray that somebody there would recognise the professional touch.”</p> <p>But no: a guard gets the same noise out of the harp. The officials shake their heads and smirk. Harpo fears imprisonment, or worse, and begins to yell about his rights, but all to no avail. It is only when his fellow American pops up on the scene, and they accept his explanation, that Harpo is allowed to board the Moscow express. “The train was unbelievably crowded, ten and twelve people to each six-passenger compartment, and it stank of disinfectant, but I thanked God I was lucky enough to be on it.”</p> <p>His show is a terrific hit with the Russians, who love clowns, but, on the way back to America, Harpo can’t shake off the awful feeling that for the past eight weeks he has been watched wherever he goes, “by eyes I couldn’t see. I never, not for a minute, felt I was really alone. I was a stranger who had stumbled into a deadly conspiracy, who had to be kept from finding out what the plot was all about.”</p> <p>But one thing above all strikes Harpo about the USSR. “I never saw anybody do anything just for the hell of it. I never saw anybody pull a spontaneous gag.” Rationality, he feels, is the only acceptable justification for everything in Stalin’s USSR: something can only be funny if it has a reason to be funny.

A solid <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-grand-budapest-hotel\">Metacritic score</a> (88/100) shows its popularity with critics, while our own Peter Bradshaw called it a “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/06/the-grand-budapest-hotel-wes-anderson-review\">deeply pleasurable immersion”</a>.

You’d perhaps expect more than five nominations, even if they are in categories (actor - Ethan Hawke, actress - Patricia Arquette, director etc) that make sense. <strong><br /></strong></li> <li><strong>Nightcrawler has done well </strong>- Tony Gilroy’s sickly satire on the TV news industry has been left on snooze up to this point. It’s four nominations here (screenplay, editing, supporting actress (Rene Russo) and actor (Jake Gyllenhaal)) could give it a welcome boost going into the Oscars</li> <li><strong>Mr Turner hasn’t</strong> - Mike Leigh’s Turner biopic has fallen on its bum a bit. It picked up four nominations in technical categories. Timothy Spall could feel rightfully aggrieved for not getting a best actor nod. Our reaction? Gnrgghhhh. </li> <li><strong>Whiplash is upping the tempo -</strong> Damien Chazelle - a whipper-snapper at 29 - should be excited this morning. People have been banging the drum for JK Simmons’ best supporting actor chances for a while, but Chazelle’s nominations (for screenplay and directing) were unexpected. <br /></li> <li><strong>Under the Skin is under the radar </strong>- No suprises that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/the-10-best-films-of-2014-no-1-under-the-skin\">our film of 2014 </a>wasn’t nominated in the major categories.

We’d expect to see Birdman up there too, along with maybe Selma, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything? <br /></p> <p>Michael Keaton will probably lead the pack in the best actor category. Other potential gong-grabbers could be Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) and David Oyelowo (Selma). Perhaps Steve Carell for Foxcatcher and maybe even The ’Batch for The Imitation Game. </p> <p>In a strangely weak year for female leads best actress will likely be dominated by Julianne Moore for Still Alice. Felicity Jones (Theory of Everything) and Reese Witherspoon (Wild) could be there, too. Rosamund Pike could join them for Gone Girl. <br /></p> <p>Finally – for now – best director. We’d called Iñárritu (Birdman), Linklater (Boyhood), DuVernay (Selma) and Fincher maybe (Gone Girl). Could Mike Leigh grab one for Mr Turner, too? </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-01-09T11:44:25.004Z\">at 11.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54aecabee4b0461a99f13920\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-09T07:27:26.058Z\">7.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still a few minutes to go before it all kicks off.

This time around we’ll be taking it slow: commenting on the highlights, noting the omissions and rounding up reaction from Twitter. We’ll link to a full list of nominees as and when we have one and follow that up with news stories, a gallery and the thoughts of our lead film critic, Peter Bradshaw.

Anderson is nominated as best director; the film is also up for best film, best original screenplay and best actor for Ralph Fiennes.</p> <p>As with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/11/birdman-soars-over-the-competition-at-2015-golden-globe-nominations\">Golden Globe nominations</a>, Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch vie for the best actor award with competing portrayals of scientific geniuses: Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything and Alan Turing in The Imitation Game. Michael Keaton and Jake Gyllenhaal round out the category, the latter perhaps filling a spot many had assumed reserved for David Oyelowo, the British actor who plays Martin Luther King in Selma. That film – an Oscar frontrunner – failed to score a single nomination. </p> <p>Perhaps trying to swerve this strong British actor field, Steve Carrell was instead put forward for the supporting actor category for his Oscar-tipped performance in Foxcatcher. He is nominated along with his co-star Mark Ruffalo.</p> <p>Nightcrawler did surprisingly well at the nomination stage, with four, including one for Rene Russo’s supporting role; outdoing them with five was Whiplash, with nods not just for JK Simmons as best supporting actor, but also in the directing, original screenplay, editing and sound categories.</p> <p>Awards favourites Birdman, The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game all scored highly, but Mr Turner, Mike Leigh’s biopic of the British artist, would have expected to do much better on home turf. Of its four nominations, none are in major categories, not even for Leigh’s direction or Timothy Spall’s Cannes-winning lead performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/08/boyhood-richard-linklater-ellar-coltrane-interview-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qy7c\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2121591\"                data-video-name=\"Richard Linklater and Ellar Coltrane on Boyhood: 'You're collaborating with an unknown future' – video interviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/4/1404486226273/Boyhood-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-441294572\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/4/1404486222754/Boyhood-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood/140704Boyhood.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>The cast and crew of Boyhood describe the 12-year -film-making process</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oscar favourite Boyhood will also disappoint its film-makers with only five nominations, though they were in major fields including best director for Richard Linklater and best film. It is being rereleased in the UK next week, ahead of its potentially lively awards season. Two other potential Oscar darlings, JC Chandor’s A Most Violent Year and Paul Thomas Anderson’s Inherent Vice, both also failed to secure any nominations at all.</p> <p>In the best actress category, Rosamund Pike gave Gone Girl one of only two nominations, suggesting its own awards campaign might falter. Felicity Jones, Reese Witherspoon, Julianne Moore and Amy Adams were also nominated.</p> <p>While Mr Turner may have been relatively ignored, Bafta used the awards to throw its weight behind some other British hits. Hit family comedy Paddington earned two nominations, as did Troubles drama ’71, while Pride earned three, including a supporting actress nod for Imelda Staunton.</p> <p>Under the Skin, the elliptical drama from Jonathan Glazer with Scarlett Johansson as a lonely alien stalking the wilds of Scotland, was given a nomination in the Outstanding British Film category, while Mica Levi was also recognised for her music. It was also named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/the-10-best-films-of-2014-no-1-under-the-skin\">best film of 2014 by the Guardian</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f964df5e-48e6-4224-b7d0-b418ef2a6dbc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/9/1420797601623/1f24eae0-003e-4651-8546-842f6f93ecfd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in The Theory of Everything\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in The Theory of Everything.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Working Title Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Working Title’s Eric Fellner, one of the producers of The Theory of Everything, told the Guardian he was “delighted” with the film’s stack of nominations, calling it “one of those rare times where it’s a conflation of three factors: we’re pleased with the film, the critics love it, and it’s a success with the real audience” – it is currently top of the UK box office charts. He also acknowledged the nod for Trash in the foreign category, calling the film an “extraordinary gamble” – it was directed by Stephen Daldry, but with a mostly Brazilian cast and crew. He expressed surprise for Selma and Spall not being nominated, though said that “it is always tough in a field as strong as this.”</p> <p>The EE Rising Star award for the best in young talent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/07/bafta-rising-star-award-nominees-jack-oconnell-gugu-mbatha-raw\">had already been announced</a>, with Shailene Woodley, Jack O’Connell, Margot Robbie, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Miles Teller.</p> <p>On hearing the news that he was unexpectedly nominated, Ralph Fiennes said in a statement: “I’m delighted of course, merci Madame Bafta. Dom Pérignon all around for guests and staff at The Grand Budapest Hotel. And a free sample of eau de panache too darling,” referring to his character’s favoured scent. Anderson meanwhile said he was “thrilled, honoured, humbled, elated – and deeply grateful” on hearing the news of the nominations.</p> <p>Cynics will say that The Grand Budapest Hotel’s success is rooted in securing a lot of minor categories, though it certainly stands a good chance of winning many of them, given Anderson’s typically witty approach to production design, costumes and music. It’s a coup for a film that only got five Golden Globe nominations, and has generally been overlooked in the year’s various <a

Our family holidays in the early days were chaotic camping trips to north Wales, where, although the beaches were sandy, it regularly rained, and our tent leaked at every seam. It was like Mike Leigh’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptugM-zad9A\">Nuts in May</a>, only madder. </p> <p>Later we went posh - with bed and breakfasts - on walking trips in the Lake District. You had to be up absurdly early for a big bacony breakfast you could barely wolf down, then - out you go! Cagoules and walking boots, massive socks, rocks and muddy, but windy, breathtaking walks with flasks of tea and Kendal Mint Cake. There was no lounge or bar or swimming pool area in which to relax. We were only allowed to return towards dusk, and, after eating fish and chips for our tea, there was rarely a communal TV, and even after a quick pub trip – if there were any within staggering distance – this left not much to do but play backgammon, battleships, Mastermind or Yahtzee in what really felt like someone’s damp-dog-smelly sitting room (because it was someone’s sitting room). And hopefully because there was actually a damp dog in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-15395271-1d4a-4ca9-a894-ca79623585ac\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420740200517/a9b53eb2-7eed-4c3f-b3b4-e594e02c9777-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Fawlty Towers hotel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can we help you?

Because of those cut-price times I still walk into hotels feeling a little naughty and mystified, as if I’m a false Dr Who setting foot in an alien land on a sneaky adventure. But coming from a musical family, hotels and songs always have an association – whether the degenerate crash zone of the travelling performer, the lonely haven of the penniless wandering minstrel, or the luxury piano-into-the-swimming pool venue of the international rock star. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ba8b4f34-57fd-4c8e-8d55-3833fd64005a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420661052564/88540c6f-b21f-4405-b903-eef5137ff3ae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Magic Mountain Hotel, Panguipulli, Chile\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dream location … Magic Mountain Hotel, in the forests of Huilo Huilo, Panguipulli, Chile</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All kinds of things go on in hotels, seedy, secretive, sexy, wild, and, as well as the humdrum, sometimes even sleep. And many a song has been written in them, often about many of such experiences. So this week it’s time to nominate any songs that have hotel associations. But by hotels we can also include bed and breakfasts, motels, and hostels – any pay-by-the-night accommodation with a solid roof, luxury or louche, heavenly or humble.<br /></p> <p>What experiences and feelings do hotels inspire? A place of holiday relaxation? Business functional boredom? Or excitement, opportunity, discretion and secret liaison? Hotels are capsules of society, style and period, holding in them a random cross-section of society, a demographic all needing a bed. Like a train carriage, they are oddly intimate, and yet anonymous. What kind of hotel do you imagine? The blandness of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossroads_%28soap_opera%29\">Crossroads Motel</a>, or the colourful splendour of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fg5iWmQjwk\">Grand Budapest Hotel</a>? Or the ugly concrete-y booze-and-bikini shagging barracks of a Benidorm holiday package? Or, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/feb/03/canaryislands.spain\">one place I visited in the Canary Islands</a>, a people-watching paradise, a surreal slow-motion zombie movie of sumptuous food mountains in a vast, endlessly replenished buffet bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcEws7il4EY\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcEws7il4EY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Basil! Basil! Fawlty Towers - unique customer service</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then again, a hotel might have the anarchic seaside town insanity of some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcEws7il4EY\">Fawlty Towers</a> or the nylon-sheet seediness of the grey and yellow dirty weekend in Brighton or Clacton-on-Sea. While some places are steeped in anonymity, hotels are also as much about the staff, whether it’s the super-discreet and efficient, or the battling barminess of a Basil Fawlty, or, as I once experienced when walking the Pennine Way after at the age of 15 with two friends, the almost frighteningly manic warden of an isolated youth hostel host in Baldersdale on the Yorkshire/Durham boggy borders. Wandering around in his underpants and chattering to himself, he had clearly gone over the edge from being alone for days at a time about 20 miles from any road or signs of civilisation. <br /></p> <p>Some hotels are steeped in the sinister, such as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VP5jEAP3K4\">Bates Motel in Hitchcock’s Psycho</a> - don’t go in that shower, Janet! - or the giant Colorado lounge and or utterly terrifying and changing geometric carpet patterns and rooms down corridors of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/24/the-shining-the-film-that-frightened-me-most\">Overlook Hotel in The Shining</a>. Redrum! Redrum! Hotels are meant to be zones of safety, but it is when that idea is upturned that they become the infinite ventricles of mental hell. Some famous musicians have found themselves trapped there for weeks. You might be able to think of a few.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9ea8b0c0-dc03-43f7-9ef6-cec1aee07417\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420661111895/5d48864d-a339-42d0-9bea-d27be22863ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Shining\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelley Duvall as Wendy and Danny Lloyd as Danny in the Colorado Lounge of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the other end of the scale there are grandest five-star hotels of multi-tipping servitude, perfumery, chocolates on pillows, shoe buffing and tassle-wearing fawning. That may be Claridge’s in London, The Ritz in Paris or the Plaza in New York. Well, if only I could confirm that personally. With luxury in mind, if you’re feeling particularly flush, there’s always the alternatives, from the extraordinary <a href=\"http://huilohuilo.travel/nuestros-alojamientos/montana-magica-lodge/\">Magic Mountain Hotel tower of Peru</a> - or the proposed undersea <a href=\"http://www.poseidonresorts.com/\">Poseidon Resort of Fiji</a> where you might be able to down in luxury in a bubble-windowed bedroom around which fish - and sharks - circle above your head. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d68881cd35f630a96d0da064dcb2ff581b9f1d8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420661381253/b3406def-4052-423e-8ca7-a2da2a184738-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Five-star luxury on the ocean floor - the imagined Poseidon Resort project.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Five-star luxury on the ocean floor - the imagined Poseidon Resort project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Huf/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or why not try the palatial turrets and lakes the <a href=\"http://www.oberoihotels.com/hotels-in-udaipur/index.aspx\">Oberoi in India</a>, the <a href=\"http://atomium.be/\">Atomium</a> in Brussels, the <a href=\"http://www.icehotel.com/\">ice hotels</a> and cube treehouses of Sweden, the <a href=\"http://www.amanresorts.com/amangiri/resort.aspx\">Amangiri Resort</a> immersing your into the clear skies absolute stillness of the Utah desert, the <a href=\"http://www.fairychimney.com/english/guesthouse/location.htm\">Fairy Chimney Hotel </a>carved into the mountains of Turkey, the <a href=\"http://howlermonkeyhotel.com/\">Howler Monkey Hotel</a> in Costa Rica (exotic noisy neighbours) or the <a href=\"http://www.andbeyond.com/ngorongoro-crater-lodge/\">Ngorongoro Crater Lodge in Tanzania</a>, right above and amongst the beasts of the jungle? For hotels are also places to dream and escape, but that is where songs can also take us, without even going anywhere. So, whether relating a hotel or other accommodation in titles, or more interestingly in the narrative of lyrics, or if a song is heavily associated with a particular hotel stay, put it forward, and let’s take a trip there.<br /></p> <p>Some background: previously the topics of pub and bars, cafes and restaurants, and holidays have come up, but the hotel offers opens up so many more facilities and many more songs, not to mention all those that didn’t get a room in older lists.

mashup of Rapunzel, Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood loses a little magic on the path from stage to screen","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>A layer of theatregoing good taste covers this entertaining if stately movie musical, based on Stephen Sondheim’s stage show, which opened in the US in 1987 and has been revived constantly since. It has been adapted for the screen by James Lapine, who wrote the book for the original Sondheim production, and robustly directed by Rob Marshall.</p> <p>Inspired by Bruno Bettelheim’s classic analysis of fairytales, it is a mythic mashup of Rapunzel, Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood, with a bit of David and Goliath somewhere somewhere in there, too. A childless baker and his wife are informed by a quivering, quavering witch that their barrenness is a result of her curse. They can cure it by journeying into the woods – that scarily inviting place where protections and inhibitions are removed – and retrieving key items from various fairytales in progress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5339c56133d074e070dd9589b2b6e664a0e56254\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420650074204/71287f44-ef6e-48cf-8de0-598e5dd647b7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Meryl Streep.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Reliably good turn as the Witch’ … Meryl Streep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This mulched-up storyline demonstrates, in its rather laborious and pedagogic way, the tales’ obsession with childhood and children. For me the multi-myth narrative loses the dramatic clarity and force that each tale had singly, without gaining much in terms of insight or comedy.</p> <p>There are some very nice performances: James Corden and Emily Blunt have a great double act going as the squabbling marrieds; Meryl Streep is a reliably good turn as the witch; and Chris Pine is excellent as the arrogant Prince, who has some of Sondheim’s sharpest rhymes (“Life is often so unpleasant/ You must know that, as a peasant”).</p> <p>There aren’t many movies so stuffed with big names that you get people of the calibre of Simon Russell Beale and Annette Crosbie appearing in minor roles. But there is an awful lot of sedate musical theatre warbling going on. I can’t help thinking the animations such as Shrek or Frozen have already done something similar with more unpretentious lightness and more joy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

In 1979, the New Zealand government dispatched a brave team of police officers to the Antarctic on a recovery mission after a New Zealand aircraft crashed into Mount Erebus with the loss of 257 lives. With as much efficiency and decency as they could, these scared, cold men had to find and retrieve the grisly corpses, as well as anything material to the investigation – including the black box, whose terrible audio recording is played at one stage in the film – all while combatting thoughts that they would themselves be added to the fatality statistics, and that they were being let down by the airline authorities whose incompetence they were exposing. It’s an interesting story, but it deserves a longer running time than just over an hour, and is more suited to television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

National Gallery in London makes it look like a secular cathedral, full of hushed grandeur. The film is presented with Wiseman’s habitual clarity and austerity: no voiceovers, no obvious direction or overall “story”, just a succession of unhurried scenes – though it is slightly shorter than his recent work – and an emphasis on talking heads and professional expertise. There is a cerebral calm. Often, as we are permitted access to a budget meeting or PR discussion, an art-history lecture, nude life study or some craftsman’s minutely exacting restoration work, you will be intensely aware of the gallery’s background silence, which is as an almost audible hum. Maybe it is the lighting or the air-con, or the distant bee-like murmur of the public in some far-off exhibition space, or maybe even the distant traffic of Trafalgar Square. We begin with an intriguing address on the subject of a work from the Middle Ages, an altarpiece designed to be seen in a church. These images were drenched in belief. Now, in our secular age, the gallery enacts this religious impulse and religious rhetoric. Wiseman begins with a succession of shots of the paintings and portraits, and juxtaposes these with the gallery visitors: they are the pilgrims of art and civic high seriousness. The curators and scholars are generally heard speaking with an echoey tone – like a priest’s address in church. An intriguing and valuable record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu7b-jGANr8\"

Lanzmann’s fascinating interview with the only Jewish ‘elder’ who negotiated with Adolf Eichmann is a subtle study in survivor non-guilt</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>At 87, Claude Lanzmann is still capable of enforcing his film-making personality on European cinema: he is a landmark in the shadow of his great subject, the Holocaust. His film, Shoah, is now best seen not merely as an incomparable record, but as an intervention in history, an insistence on eyewitness testimony and compelling truth. This new film is a remarkable companion to his masterpiece Shoah: a fascinating encounter, recorded in Rome in the 1970s, while working on his great film but not used at the time, for reasons that Lanzmann leaves us to ponder.</p> <p>It is an interview with Benjamin Murmelstein, an Austrian Jew and last surviving “chairman” of the Theresienstadt ghetto, near Prague, a supposedly comfortable Potemkin-style arrangement that was part of a sickening pantomime of ostensible good faith after the Anschluss. Murmelstein explains that their inhabitants, and the world, were distracted with the fatuous fantasy of being shipped over to Madagascar: a cynical euphemism for the death marches and extermination, in which Murmelstein was held to be complicit. The Nazis coerced leading Jews to be their administrative “elders” there, a queasy use of Judeophobe-propagandist terminology, and Murmelstein was the last surviving example (his predecessors were murdered by the Nazis). <br /></p> <p>He was a man hated after the war for being a collaborator. But he was someone who perhaps saved lives due to his endless and often terrifying negotiations with Adolf Eichmann on the subject of emigration, when the Nazi authorities still believed that allowing Jews to depart without their money might be practicable and profitable.</p> <p>Lanzmann treats Murmelstein with generosity, emphasising the cruelty and sadism with which these elders were treated. Murmelstein is a riveting subtle study in survivor non-guilt – voluble, eloquent and shrewd. But as the story progresses towards 1945, and the fact that Thereisenstadt’s inhabitants perished and he did not, Murmelstein becomes increasingly vehement and even slightly hysterical. <br /></p> <p>Lanzmann sombrely introduces his film at the railway station. These stations – modern places with their tracks receding endlessly over the horizon – look like anti-memorials. As for Murmelstein, he is almost, like Eichmann, a refugee, in exile or hiding. Lanzmann himself is perhaps part interlocutor and part confessor, like Gitta Sereny with Albert Speer. The film itself is haunted and haunting.</p>","headline":"The Last of the Unjust review – doc about a divisive Holocaust survivor","trailText":"Claude Lanzmann’s fascinating interview with the only

You’ve made a good movie, I tell Miller, as you might tell somebody they have lost weight, only realising too late this means you once thought they were fat.</p> <p>Miller is quiet for a moment. “You said that with real surprise,” she says, then bursts out laughing. We’re in a private room above a cinema in west London, Miller wearing torn jeans and cardigan, her blonde hair cut to the jaw. “You’ve made a good movie,” she says, repeating my line as it sounded to her, “FOR ONCE.” Chuckling, Miller adds: “Well… <em>actually</em>…”</p> <p>Something has happened to this career. Unexpectedly, by the sounds of it even to her, Sienna Miller has started working on really good stuff. Not only <em>American Sniper</em>, out this week, which with its Clint-and-Cooper combo will surely figure in awards-givers’ minds come January. Also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/foxcatcher\"><em>Foxcatcher</em></a>, Bennett Miller’s wrestling drama in which Miller has a small role. “It’s the first time,” she says, “I’ve been in some Serious Films of The Year.”</p> <p>Next year she’ll appear in <em>Black Mass</em>, a Johnny Depp gangster flick, playing his moll, as well as in work by indie reliable Ben Wheatley and Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, the American duo behind 2006 award-chum <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115527/half.nelson\"><em>Half Nelson</em></a>. What’s happened? Miller shrugs. “All the directors speak to each other. And once you crack that upper echelon of incredible directors, you’ve got people rooting for you. People who people listen to. I’ve never had that before.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/oct/06/american-sniper-trailer-bradley-cooper-clint-eastwood-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/427fv\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2170638\"                data-video-name=\"American Sniper: watch the trailer for the Iraq war film starring Bradley Cooper – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/6/1412604768637/American-Sniper-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-448994208\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/6/1412604752042/American-Sniper-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/06/141006AmericanSniper-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/06/141006AmericanSniper_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/06/141006AmericanSniper/141006AmericanSniper.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/06/141006AmericanSniper.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/06/141006AmericanSniper_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for American Sniper</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her IMDB page confirms it. Before 2012, the bio looks… unmethodical. She grew up in Wiltshire “feeling mostly frustrated” at boarding school, then got her first paid work in a German Coke advert at 17. “I quite successfully, I think, attempted to speak German. And then they dubbed me.” With the ad money she moved to New York to enrol at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. “Four hours trying to smell an imaginary lemon,” is how she summarises the training, conceding she didn’t attend for long. In her early 20s she was cast in two studio films, Paramount’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,4267,1334587,00.html\"><em>Alfie</em></a>, opposite Jude Law, and Columbia’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/102302/layer.cake\"><em>Layer Cake</em></a>, with Daniel Craig. After this there were decent performances in a pair of low-flying biopics (on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/mar/18/fashion\">Edie Sedgwick</a> and on Dylan Thomas) and a part in the blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131071/gi-joe\"><em>GI Joe: the Rise of Cobra</em></a>.</p> <p><em>GI Joe</em> came out in 2009. Even at the time Miller could hardly make it through a press conference without acknowledging it wasn’t really her sort of movie. The career had lost its way. Her personal life – at least as sieved by the red tops – looked a mess, any idea of her as a working actor swamped by stories about her relationships with famous men, Jude Law most prominently. In her earliest Hollywood days, Miller had a tendency to show up for meetings with executives underprepared (her hair smelling of last night’s cigarettes, say) and perhaps not enough studio-level goodwill was built up to buoy her through a particularly bad period in 2008, when she had an affair with a married American actor, Balthazar Getty, this unfolding drama reported on in American gossip magazines as if it were an election race. “Quite chaotic,” is Miller’s summary of her 20s, when I ask.</p> <p>Profile, that newsprint-y skin on an actor’s life, shouldn’t count. It does though, at least where cautious studio decision-makers are concerned. The thinking among certain casting agents, Miller once said, is that “People don’t want to see films with people they don’t approve of in them.” She took a break from screen work, performing in plays in London and New York. After a series of successful court actions against intrusive media agencies she had much more privacy and space in which to settle into a relationship with British actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/19/tom-sturridge-carey-mulligan-thomas-hardy\">Tom Sturridge</a>. In 2012 the couple had a daughter, Marlowe.</p> <p>“And I think having a baby really changed everything, if I’m honest,” Miller tells me. “I think that’s where it began.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aac351f14a06cc46137124e88c4d618c59eda543\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419958884487/0dabbd07-d200-4a57-83cb-7f36701526d9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sienna Miller shot for the Observer at Spring Studios\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Once you have a baby, the stakes are higher. You have someone who you want to be proud of you eventually’: Sienna Miller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Driu Crilly and Tiago Martel/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In our room above the cinema a waiter brings in a plate of food for her. A little bowl of Heinz-orange tomato soup and a small toasted cheese sandwich, cut into fingers. “Did you accidentally order from the children’s’ menu?” I ask. “Possibly,” she says. “That’s where my brain is these days.” She gestures at her open handbag, poking out of which is the corner of a packet of wet wipes. She scans for spilled proof, on her jeans, that she spent the morning making gingerbread with the kid.</p> <p>What does she mean, that having a baby changed things? Miller thinks and then gives me an interesting three-pronged answer. For one, she says: “The stakes are higher. You have someone that you want to be proud of you eventually.” Motherhood also gave her a sense of time running out. “You’re aware of your own mortality. For me, as soon as I had a baby I had a vision of my life – and what was left of it.”</p> <p>The third point she feels her way into, clearly not all that comfortable with its implications. She thinks that being a mother changed strangers’ opinion of her; not the general public but the execs and casting agents, who might once have worried about putting “people they don’t approve of” into their movies. “I’m sure that factors. People who read the negative things [about me], the people who <em>need</em> persuading, are probably ignorant enough to assume, ‘Well she’s got a kid so she’s serious now.’ Which, of course, isn’t the case. I’m still whoever I was. Maybe more mature, but the same. So amongst that ignorant, ridiculous area of my industry, I’m sure opinions of me have changed because I’m a mother now.”</p> <p>The military family that Bradley Cooper and Miller portray in <em>American Sniper </em>is based on a real couple, Chris and Taya Kyle. While Taya raised the Kyle family back in Texas, Chris was away for the better part of a decade in Fallujah. His job there was “overwatching” marines – shooting any threats to them with a sniper rifle – and in this role he killed more people than any equivalent in American armed-forces history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8029327c02dcd7a72ed9c82c01be8ec6b620a46\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/29/1419858422219/3d8c5394-9703-417b-a4c7-534c4c9f14af-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sienna Miller is embraced by Clint Eastwood at the premiere of American Sniper\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Once you crack that upper echelon of incredible directors, you’ve got people rooting for you’: with Clint Eastwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lamparski/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I mentioned this film was morally complicated. From the first scene on we watch Cooper/Kyle assassinate not just men but women and children, any Iraqis, basically, he judges to be dangerous. As a viewer you’re never sure whether director Eastwood (hardly a noted disarmament guy) regrets the sheer <em>effectiveness</em> of his killer protagonist. Miller’s Taya is much easier to root for, the recipient of battle-interrupted phone calls, mortified when her husband returns to US soil and goes to a bar first, before coming home.</p> <p>Miller got to know the real Taya Kyle. “Because she never knew whether Chris was going to make it back she kept every email they ever wrote to each other.” Miller read them all. I ask how that made her feel, picking through a couple’s private correspondence. “Taya offered. And it was with the intention of really understanding what her relationship with Chris was. But it was very personal and I did feel uncomfortable.” It’s a bizarre place for you of all people to end up, I suggest. “Reading other people’s emails?” Miller laughs darkly. “Yeah.”</p> <p>Her written statement to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards, submitted in 2011, began: “I am an actress. I have also been the subject of a lot of unwanted media attention over the years by the tabloid press.” Crisp, clean, dignified – and probably the last time her involvement in the phonehacking farrago was in any way so. Looking back on the Great Celebrity Revolt of 2011, when famous people stopped being too afraid of News Corp and the Trinity Group to speak against their treatment, we tend to remember Hugh Grant, secretly recording an incriminating conversation with one reporter, or Steve Coogan, appearing on <em>Newsnight</em> to eviscerate another. I’m not sure Miller gets the credit she deserves for her own staunch work. She put in years of legal legwork, long before the scandal broke, helping to ready the ground for reform.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ec28f633ed0fdf82245c20c478d9b3c0198d440\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/29/1419858638246/8051f043-c746-4f89-b6b0-c39691c8bec8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sienna Miller in a black dress shot at Spring Studios\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Characterised as a ‘silly little girl’, Sienna Miller took court action when she ‘started to believe in the tabloid perception’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Driu Crilly and Tiago Martel/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From 2008 onwards Miller launched court actions against the <em>Mirror</em>, the <em>Daily Star</em>, the <em>News of the World </em>and a specific paparazzo, Warren Richardson, who took secret photographs of her while she was naked on the set of a film. Characterised in the press as “a silly little tabloid girl” for most of the previous decade, she first took court action, she tells me, “because at a certain point I started to believe in their perception of me. I kind of lost myself in it. I felt like I didn’t have an identity any more. The perception had become so big, and such a huge thing… I couldn’t really remember who I actually was.”</p> <p>Her voicemails, of course, were among those hacked by <em>News of the World </em>journalists in the middle 2000s. “I’d just found out I was pregnant,” she tells me of the day she appeared before the judge. “A walking hormone. Leveson knew, and I think they probably would’ve probed me a bit harder had they not known I’d been puking on the way there.”</p> <p>I have a vivid memory of you, I say, wringing your hands under the table as you spoke. “It was such an intimidating room. It was clinical, and cold, and legal. I didn’t want to stumble, or say the wrong thing. It was such sensitive subject matter that I have such an emotional response to – and I didn’t want to be emotional.” More than anything, she says, “it felt like an odd thing to do. Because in a sense everything I’d fought against was to make this stuff go away. And doing that felt like it was reminding, perpetuating, everything being dug up again.”</p> <p>If she doesn’t regret her involvement in Leveson, she certainly regrets taking part in this year’s hacking trial against Andy Coulson and Rebecca Brooks. Miller was in Boston filming with Johnny Depp and was examined as a witness at the Old Bailey via webcam.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"788fcccd8ea606b4397f7eec58a7e8af8591f06e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/29/1419858947031/7ce29049-3397-4d8c-a048-89c9ad04bec7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"With Jude Law in Alfie in 2004.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Jude Law in Alfie (2004)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PARAMOUNT/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First her relationship with Jude Law, long since amicably ended, was picked over. (“We spoke after Jude had done his [testimony] and he said: ‘Do not do it. Get out of it.’ And I couldn’t.”) Then, a voicemail from 2005 was read out, one left by Miller on Daniel Craig’s phone that included the words “I love you”. The suggestion in court was that Miller and Craig were in a relationship at the time. She tells me: “Somehow what came out of that was that I’d been having these affairs. Which was not the case. And suddenly Jude and I were on the cover of the newspaper again. And the timeline was all off. You know, it was just horrible to be back there.</p> <p>“It was handled really badly. They wheeled people out for the show. And I got thrown under the bus a bit. It reminded people of things I didn’t want to remind them of… But I did manage to get out a joke in court.”</p> <p>Often, during my hour with Miller, I’ve been surprised by her sideways humour. (“How tall are you?” Six foot five. “Oh! Circus tall.”) When a prosecutor at the Old Bailey trial started to read out Miller’s I-love-you voicemail to Craig, there was a technical hitch. Her webcam transmission from Boston was delayed and she accidentally interrupted the barrister as he was about to start reading. He paused. She said no, sorry, go on – I think you were about to tell me you loved me? “Apparently he went <em>purple</em>.”</p> <p>I like this about Miller. Damage has been done, nothing will undo it – so laugh. Humour’s one sure way of deflecting a slight, after all. Another is success. Cheesy voicemail recitals and hand-wringing Leveson testimonies will be utterly lost in the conversation, I expect, should Miller’s films get the outings they deserve come awards season. Though she says she doesn’t expect any nominations for herself, I tell her I think <em>Foxcatcher</em> is sure to contend in the best film category.

It’s a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/selma-review-civil-rights-drama\">gorgeous and brave film</a> that tells the story of the 1965 marches from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/dec/17/1965-selma-montgomery-march-stephen-somerstein\">Selma to Montgomery</a>, led by Dr Martin Luther King Jr.</p> <p>When DuVernay began filming Selma this year, she could not have predicted that in August, a young unarmed black man named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown would be shot </a>by police in Ferguson, Missouri. She could not have predicted that a grand jury would decide not to indict police officers in the death of not just Mike Brown, but also in the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>. </p> <p>And yet, Selma lands perfectly in sync with the unrest that has characterized the last few months for black America. By grounding the film in the conversations being had in America in 2014, Selma succeeds in transcending the historical drama cateogory – it’s as contemporary as ever, and as real and familiar as it could be. </p> <p>There’s a scene in the film where Martin Luther King, played by David Oyelowo, speaks to his congregation after a young black man has been shot. His fury rises as he wonders: “how many fingers were on that trigger? Every white preacher who stands silent. Every Negro who stands back.” The conversation about the silence of white Americans about racial injustice is one that is most likely taking place right now, and with nearly the same language.</p> <p>DuVernay isn’t the only black director making brave, forward-thinking cinema. She is among the leaders of a new school of black filmmakers who are creating new contemporary narratives for the black experience. DuVernay made history by becoming the first black woman to be nominated for best director at the Golden Globes; Selma is up for best picture.</p> <p>Also at the forefront of this movement are Justin Simien, the writer and director of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uag2G0J6iqw\">Dear White People</a>; Ryan Coogler, whose 2013 directorial debut, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxUJwJfcQaQ\">Fruitvale Station</a>, took home the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance; Beyond The Lights director Gina Prince-Bythewood, and, of course, British artist-turned-director Steve McQueen, whose third feature film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02Ie8wKKRg\">12 Years A Slave</a>, won the Oscar for best picture this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073/0_51_2712_1627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Oyelowo, center, as Martin Luther King Jr and Carmen Ejogo, right, as Coretta Scott King in Selma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simien’s film satirically explores crises in modern blackness, while Coogler’s Fruitvale Station chronicles the events that led to the death of Oscar Grant, a young black man from Oakland. McQueen’s film, 12 Years A Slave, brought slavery to audiences in brutal realism rarely seen on the screen.</p> <p>These directors are reimagining possibilities not just for black filmmakers, but for new stories to be told about the black experience – and audiences are interested. Fruitvale Station was made for the paltry sum of $900,000 and so far has made more than $17m. Simien described Dear White People’s budget as “real low”, and said that film is approaching $4.5m at the box office. And 12 Years A Slave has banked more than $185m on a $22m budget. With Oscar buzz building around Selma, it’s easy to imagine the film being equally successful.</p> <p>The encouraging reaction has spurred interest from studios in making more black films. McQueen has announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/18/steve-mcqueen-to-make-film-about-paul-robeson\">his next project will be about the singer Paul Robeson</a>, the civil rights activist, singer and actor. Meanwhile, Coogler’s <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-followup-creed-building-cast-shoot-dates-eyed-20141111\">next film will be entitled Creed,</a> and is a spinoff of the Rocky films centering on the grandson of Apollo Creed, the black boxer whom Rocky beats to become champion. </p> <p>These filmmakers are making markedly different films than the projects Hollywood was interested in just 5 years ago. Only Lee Daniels’ Precious warranted any attention from the Oscars. That film received a great deal of criticism for telling a one-dimensional story of the black experience: poor, downtrodden and gratuitously hopeless. It’s a story that targets a specific audience. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111703465.html?nav=rss_email/components&amp;sid=ST2009111703607\">Courtland Milloy criticized</a> the exaggerated story of black life portrayed in Precious: “When human pathology is given a black face, white people don’t have to feel so bad about their own.”</p> <p>Fast forward to 2014 and one of the year’s most significant releases is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/top-five-review-chris-rock-toronto-movie\">Chris Rock’s comedy Top Five</a>. The central theme of that film is the rejection of singular, dominant narratives. Chris Rock’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/17/chris-rock-the-top-five-moments-from-his-top-five-promo-tour\">promotion of the film</a>, has sparked interesting conversations about new realities of race and racism in the US. There is a great deal to dissect about race relations today, and grounding these films in the contemporary black experience stands in contrast to films that Hollywood usually hungers for.</p> <p>There was a serious lull in black films about contemporary experience, but with directors such as DuVernay, Simien, Coogler and McQueen, it seems we’ve entered a new and promising era where stories about blackness are told by artists who are as concerned with the storytelling as they are with how their work will resonate with those who have lived the black experience in America. That is no small thing.</p>","headline":"2014: the year that black cinema bounced back in America","trailText":"Selma’s release caps an interesting 18 months for black cinema, a period when filmmakers got back to to telling complex, honest and unflinching stories about life in America","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419432229274/34380444-bf4b-4078-af43-c0a0a6f607d5-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"865","commentable":"true","byline":"Elamin Abdelmahmoud","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-28T13:00:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/2014-the-year-that-black-cinema-bounced-back-in-america","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/25/2014-the-year-that-black-cinema-bounced-back-in-america","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/selma","webTitle":"Selma","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/selma","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/selma","references":[]},{"id":"film/12-years-a-slave","webTitle":"12 Years A Slave","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/12-years-a-slave","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/12-years-a-slave","references":[]},{"id":"film/fruitvale-station","webTitle":"Fruitvale Station","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fruitvale-station","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/fruitvale-station","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/martin-luther-king","webTitle":"Martin Luther King","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/oscars","webTitle":"Oscars","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/oscars","references":[]},{"id":"film/golden-globes","webTitle":"Golden Globes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/golden-globes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/golden-globes","references":[]},{"id":"film/top-five","webTitle":"Top Five","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/top-five","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/top-five","references":[]},{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/race","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/race","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"profile/elamin-abdelmahmoud","webTitle":"Elamin Abdelmahmoud","r2ContributorId":"66761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414072350219/Elamin-Abdelmahmoud.jpg","firstName":"elamin","lastName":"abdelmahmoud","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Elamin Abdelmahmoud is a Canadian writer and journalist living in Toronto.

while “continuing to be friends and co-parent their children”, a spokeswoman has said.<br /></p> <p>The director and actor, who never married, separated amicably earlier this year and were asking for privacy for themselves and their children, said the spokeswoman.</p> <p>The pair met in 2001 during filming of Planet Of The Apes, which Burton directed, and have since collaborated on films including Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street, Alice In Wonderland and Dark Shadows.</p> <p>They famously live in adjoining mews houses in north London and have two children, Billy, 11, and Nell, seven. </p> <p>In the past Bonham Carter, 48, has described the arrangement with Burton, 56, as “nothing more interesting than two houses knocked together”, but in a 2011 interview she revealed that their home featured weird and wonderful items including an oversized chair from the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory set, a baby door and a gypsy caravan.</p> <p>In 2012 both were given British Film Institute fellowships, the body’s highest honour. In an interview at the time Bonham Carter said: “It’s good because there’s no jealousy at home.</p> <p>“It’s very handy and very thoughtful for them to give us both one at the same

Try these 10 festive films instead","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-23T14:00:05Z","sectionName":"Film","sectionId":"film","id":"film/2014/dec/23/christmas-festive-films-home-alone-youve-got-mail","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44bqj","standfirst":"<p>If you’ve had too much McAllister then there are plenty of other holiday movies to sink into with a glass of port in hand – and we don’t mean Love Actually</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>First things first: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099785/\">Home Alone </a>is the perfect Christmas movie, and if you don’t agree, then you’re wrong, and I’m sorry.</p> <p>That being said, there’s still such a thing as too much McAllister. Too much Harry, too much Marv – and too much reconciling the sad truth that Kevin never ate that delicious-looking plate of macaroni and cheese he prayed to and in front of. (Which is just one of the reasons we know he grew up to be a criminal sociopath.) That’s why we’ve assembled this list of “holiday” movies you can bask in when you need to keep the traditional choices at bay.</p> <p>Sorry, Buzz and friends.</p> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/\">Die Hard</a> (1988)</h2> <p>It’s the Christmas movie in which Alan Rickman’s character doesn’t cheat on Emma Thompson. (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/16/how-we-made-love-actually\">Love Actually</a> – never forget.) Instead, Rickman plays a German terrorist named Hans Gruber who takes Bruce Willis (John McClane)’s wife hostage – along with others – at a Christmas party, making this soiree way worse than anything your company has ever thrown. The good news? Bruce Willis’ reputation as an action hero holds up. The better? <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2007/06/yippeekiyay.html\">“Yippee ki yay, motherfucker.”</a></p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/prometheus\">Prometheus</a> (2012)</h2> <p>No matter what goes down at your family Christmas this year, remember it’s nowhere near as bad as what happens when a team of explorers land on an alien planet on Christmas day, and must subsequently defend the future of mankind as we know it. However, bonus points for a scene in which Idris Elba decorates a small tree alone on the ship. Charlie Brown would be proud.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/silver-linings-playbook\">Silver Linings Playbook</a> (2012)</h2> <p>True, Silver Linings Playbook takes place over the course of a few months, but the catalyst comes at Christmas, when Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) perform at a dance competition at a festively-decorated hotel. (And that’s all I’m going to tell you.)</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/edward-scissorhands-burton-fantasy\">Edward Scissorhands</a> (1990)</h2> <p>Look. Not to spoil a movie you’ve had 24 years to see, but on top of scenes filled with holiday imagery (lights, trees and tinsel), we learn that the reason it snows every Christmas is because Edward (Johnny Depp) once made snow – and an ice sculpture – for the woman he loved (Winona Ryder) to dance in, and kept doing it, even though they couldn’t be together. (No I’m not crying – you’re crying. Don’t look at me.)</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/10/3\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> (1999)</h2> <p>If you’re into traditional holiday films you’ve found the perfect reason not to watch this. Set at Christmas, Kubrick’s tale of marriage and (in)fidelity is accompanied by traditional trees and lights, creating a stark contrast between the beauty of the season and the movie’s dark halls, capes, masks and dead people. (The last scene will also change the way you see Christmas shopping, forever.)</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/08/my-guilty-pleasure-trading-places\">Trading Places </a>(1983)</h2> <p>But enough of the bleak: Trading Places delivers the hilarious cautionary tale of what happens when two greedy, evil bankers opt to ruin a stockbroker’s (Dan Aykroyd) life. Granted, the movie’s not entirely set at Christmas, but we get a scene where Akroyd eats salmon while wearing a Santa suit which, as far as I’m concerned, is the gift that keeps on giving.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433400/\">Just Friends</a> (2005)</h2> <p>Ryan Reynolds represents the best and worst of us as Chris Brander, a guy whose life was miserable in high school, and whose rejection at the hands of best pal Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart) “turned” him into a womanizer in his adult years. Alas, when he comes home for Christmas, disaster ensues – especially since most of us know that our hometowns will never allow us to escape who we once were.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/nov/13/markkermode\">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a> (2005)</h2> <p>Michelle Monaghan’s Christmas ensemble may be one of the only giveaways that this Robert Downey Jr/Val Kilmer vehicle is a holiday film, but that’s why we’re all here anyway, right? Enter: a hugely underrated film noir that sees a thief, actress, private eye and partridge in a pear tree (just kidding) forced to solve a murder-mystery. Just like the Christmas story taught us.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/23/why-i-love-movie-computers\">You’ve Got Mail </a>(1998)</h2> <p>Admittedly, You’ve Got Mail takes place from October to spring, but what matters most is that the movie’s most compelling scenes – when Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) discovers that Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is ShopGirl, when they have coffee, when Kathleen realizes she’s probably going to lose her store (and again, no, not crying) –occur over the Best Time of Year™. This is also the second time Nora Ephron busted out Christmas catalysts: in 1993’s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108160/\">Sleepless in Seattle</a>, Tom Hanks’ Sam Baldwin calls into the radio station for the first time on Christmas, just as Meg Ryan’s Annie Reed tunes in. And that’s why all other Christmas movies – and other movies in general – are garbage.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558610,00.html\">Batman Returns</a> (1992)</h2> <p>Why does Batman Returns take place at Christmas? Easy: so Batman, Catwoman, the Penguin, and Max can fight under and using various decorations. Because the snow adds a little magic to the bleak Gotham cityscape. Because otherwise we wouldn’t know that mistletoe is poisonous. Also, because this was directed by Tim Burton, and by now we know that the only thing he loves more than Halloween is spooky Christmas. Way better than Bane’s shearling coat of The Dark Knight Rises. (Sorry, Christopher Nolan.) </p>","headline":"Bored by Home Alone?

Not to mention her soft spot for the BBC. “I love the BBC,” said Lohan. “I haven’t heard myself mentioned on TV since I have been here. That has been really weird for me, and great.”</p> <p>Lohan, who has lived in the capital for nine months, has a lease for another year on her flat in the West End and is currently planning to make it her permanent residence. “I won’t live in LA again, hell no. My friends tell me shit when they come over I don’t want to hear,” said Lohan. “I don’t even know who got married and who got pregnant. You turn on the news in LA and it is all gossip about people. All the stuff that is going on in the world right now and this gossip is the news? I can go for a run here [London] on my own ... I do every morning, early, and I think how my friends in New York would still be up partying at that time. I needed to grow up and London is a better place for me to do that than anywhere else. In LA I didn’t know what to do, apart from go out every night. That’s when my friends were free. And I would go out and there would be all these cameras there and that’s when it became difficult.”</p> <p>Lohan, who recently starred in the West End play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/05/speed-the-plow-lindsay-lohan-review-playhouse-london-schiff-lindsay-posner\" title=\"\"><em>Speed-the-Plow</em></a>, decided to turn her back on the west coast while holidaying alone in Greece over the summer. It was the first time she had ever been on holiday by herself. “I just wandered about on my own! I turned my phone off. It was so extraordinarily freeing for me. Like another life.”</p> <p>She credits the turnaround in her life, in part, to Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey provided Lohan with the self-help book <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/untethered-soul.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Untethered Soul</em></a> by Michael Singer, and it has since become Lohan’s “bible”, guiding her away from the destructive voice in her head. “There’s a chapter called ‘The Rose and the Thorn’, you sit on a couch and you imagine that voice in your head as a person next to you. You learn how to distance yourself from that person.”</p> <p>The second stage of her transformation, according to the interview, was learning to be punctual – now she is determined not to miss any appointments, especially when it comes to her stage work in London.</p> <p>“One time I was sick with a bug. I had been vomiting all day, but no way was I going to miss a show. I was sitting there beforehand seeing spots in front of my eyes. I had a plan: if I felt sick on stage I was going to faint, play dead, pretend it was part of the script. Didn’t happen, fortunately.”</p>","headline":"Lindsay Lohan: why I want to make London my home","trailText":"Actor talks about her love affair with the capital, the BBC and why Oprah Winfrey is responsible for the turnaround in her life<br /><br /><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/13/lindsay-lohan-interview-london-stage-debut\" title=\"\">• Lindsay Lohan interview: ‘I needed to grow up’</a>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/14/1418549321890/Lindsay-Lohan-in-Speed-th-006.jpg","wordcount":"527","commentable":"false","byline":"Ashley Cowburn","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-17T09:33:35Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/14/lindsay-lohan-london-bbc-oprah-winfrey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/14/lindsay-lohan-london-bbc-oprah-winfrey","tags":[{"id":"film/lindsay-lohan","webTitle":"Lindsay Lohan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lindsay-lohan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/lindsay-lohan","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ashley-cowburn","webTitle":"Ashley Cowburn","r2ContributorId":"53899","firstName":"ashley","lastName":"cowburn","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ashley Cowburn is a political reporter at The Observer and winner of the Anthony Howard Award 2014.

The pluses are mainly monetary – I can help friends and family. To be able to say to a friend who’s in trouble: “Don’t worry, I can pay your rent” is a privilege.</p> <p><strong>I never had the shock </strong>of losing all my privacy. I started in showbiz at 11 months old and it’s always been my reality.</p> <p><strong>My mother’s alcoholism</strong> kept me on the straight and narrow throughout my childhood and teen years. I was a caretaker to a drinker. I didn’t have time to consider going off the rails myself – all I wanted to do was to get A’s in school and keep my mum alive.</p> <p><strong>I didn’t understand the furore </strong>around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Baby_%281978_film%29\"><em>Pretty Baby</em></a> [in which Shields played a prostitute, age 11]. My mum was furious. I remember her saying: “Did you like what you did?” I said yes, so she said: “Then fuck ’em if they can’t handle it.”</p> <p><strong>Michael Jackson and I were very close. </strong>He was the first to get in touch when my dad got sick and the first there when he died. We went through a lot together, but I’ll always remember how we laughed. I was devastated when he died. I felt like a zombie.</p> <p><strong>I was ready to go down in a ball of flames</strong> to become a mother. It took seven rounds of IVF to get pregnant with my daughter Rowan. It made me a crazy person – I was so focused on having a child that I couldn’t see anything else. Totally selfish, but I needed to create a family for my own sanity.</p> <p><strong>Children have the sharpest instincts. </strong>They tend to be wary of adults they don’t feel comfortable with. I can tell whether someone is genuine immediately and I’ve been able to do that from a very young age – I was like a little shark sensing blood in the water.</p> <p><strong>Cannes Festival in 1978 </strong>was one of the worst experiences of my life. <em>Pretty Baby</em> was nominated for the Palme d’Or and I remember being terrified, caught in a huge crowd, a pair of scissors appearing from the corner of my eye as a fan tried to cut my hair off. I’d never experienced that sort of vicious adoration.</p> <p><strong>Postpartum depression</strong> is the hardest thing I’ve had to get through. It still colours the dynamic I have with my daughter. I feel residual guilt. At the time Tom Cruise criticised my use of antidepressants and therapy very publicly. The one thing I can thank him for is that it raised awareness of the illness.</p> <p><strong>I’m a New Yorker through and through.</strong> It’s where I grew up and where I live now. That meant I wasn’t constantly with people in the entertainment industry – I had a proper foundation, surrounded by my father’s family. It’s probably the reason I’m relatively sane today.</p> <p><strong>I no longer talk to my ex-husband</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/08/open-autobiography-andre-agassi\">Andre Agassi</a>. The last time we had an exchange he asked me to look at his book and change the bits involving me according to what the truth was. He ignored me anyway and made it look like I’d sanctioned his version. There’s no anger, but he had the opportunity to reach out when my mother died [in 2012], and he didn’t.</p> <p><strong>I’m scared of having unrealised potential</strong>. I don’t feel I’ve done enough. Let’s face it, the acting in <em>The Blue Lagoon</em> wasn’t exactly great.</p> <p>There was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me,<em> by Brooke Shields, is out now,</em> <em>priced £17.99</em></p>","headline":"Brooke Shields: ‘As a child, I was like a little shark sensing blood in the water’","trailText":"The actor and model, 49, on having an alcoholic mother, postpartum

IDF","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-05T16:32:19Z","sectionName":"Film","sectionId":"film","id":"film/2014/dec/05/zero-motivation-review-female-soldiers-idf","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44vhx","standfirst":"<p>Writer-director Talya Lavie was inspired by her own time in the Israeli Defense Force and paints a picture of day-dreaming, gender politics and high heels</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>If you show a staple gun in the first act it has to go off in the third. But that’s about the only dramatic principle to which the characters in Zero Motivation adhere. Normally that would be a problem, seeing as how this film is set in the army, but it’s not like we’re on the battle lines. Writer-director Talya Lavie drew from her own personal experience in the Israeli Defense Forces, setting her first feature in the dullest administrative office in a remote desert base. The elevator pitch “Girls meets M*A*S*H” may seem a tad reductive, but it’s apt. The angst is the same though the specifics, and urgency, has changed.</p> <p>The Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of Paper and Shredding, Daffi (Nelly Tagar), has devoted her life’s efforts toward one goal: to transfer her compulsory military service to a base in Tel Aviv. Visions of walking amid gleaming towers in high heels are the only thing keeping her alive. This potential abandonment causes some stress for her pal Zohar (Dana Ivgy), a coarse and slightly unkempt fellow secretary/soldier whose sole job, it would seem, is playing Minesweeper on an outdated computer. Zohar is a Yossarian-esque rascal, the only one who can see that everyone else at the base is nuts. If Daffi goes, Zohar will be left alone with the twin ditzes who sing pop songs and twirl their gum, a brusque Russian immigrant who makes fatalist remarks in a voice so low certain dogs couldn’t hear it and the by-the-book commander whose twin passions are paperwork and brown-nosing. It’s a textbook case of an individual mortified by dense authority. If Bill Murray were a twenty-something Israeli woman, he’d be Dana Igvy as the disheveled kibbutznik in Zero Motivation.</p> <p>The bulk of the film plays out in episodic form (indeed, it is segmented in three chapters) but this sitcom-like setup serves a purpose. Characters weave in and out. Someone that seems key will drift away as someone that seemed merely a gag takes center stage for a while. This approach works well to underscore the feeling of a life in which unseen and inexplicable forces are in control. In time, Zohar’s brusk exterior reveals an inner timidity beneath her khaki parka. She’s actually a virgin, likely the only one on the base, and if dating weren’t difficult enough these days try working that out as a new platoon of handsome paratroopers bunk down for just a few nights.</p> <p>The comedy in Zero Motivation ranges from wordplay to visual gags to some “saw that coming down Broadway” moments of comeuppance. There is, however, an undercurrent of sadness, particularly with Rama (Shani Klein) the group leader. Clearly she’s the foil – she keeps a framed photo of Margaret Thatcher on her wall – but it’s not her fault her battalion of paper filers are the Bad News Bears of the Israeli desert, and the way in which the male officers disregard her smacks of unspoken sexism. She’s passed over for a promotion for another woman, but are any men in her position asked to serve coffee?</p> <p>There are no references to Hamas or Palestinians or Arabs or anything else connoting the unending conflict in the Middle East. Yet our bumbling leads are reminded time and again that “we are at war” and “our soldiers are dying”. The only nod to headlines or history is a shot of a woman stapling up posters commemorating Israel’s numerous conflicts from 1948 through to our current decade. The degree to which real danger and bloodshed is ignored in Zero Motivation adds a strange urgency what could otherwise be an Office Space-like lark. When the movie does take some dark turns, it’s almost a relief.</p> <p>There are some whose politics have no room for a film like this. “This is not a laughing matter”, they’ll say. This attitude negates reality, and perhaps negates storytelling in general. Zero Motivation is a shot of honesty, in which short-term goals are far more important than larger geo-political ones. Perhaps because they are the only ones over which we have any control.</p>","headline":"Zero Motivation review – an off-kilter look at female soldiers in the IDF","trailText":"Writer-director Talya Lavie was inspired by her own time in the Israeli Defense Force and paints a picture of day-dreaming, gender politics and high heels","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/5/1417794874505/e4dffb95-3be7-4ea5-ac10-adb077463610-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"682","commentable":"true","starRating":"4","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-08T11:30:00-05:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/zero-motivation-review-female-soldiers-idf","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/05/zero-motivation-review-female-soldiers-idf","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/israel","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

I sometimes hear a voice and think: “That could be a character I could do.” Of course there are many different grades, right up to the autism spectrum, and I am nowhere near that. But I sympathise with children who have it.</p> <p><strong>As I’ve grown older </strong>I’ve become less focused on show business. I am no longer writing and pitching scripts. I am much more picky about the movies I do. In the 80s and 90s I was away from my family a lot, so I am trying to make up for that by spending time with them now.</p> <p><strong>I don’t draw inspiration from my childhood. </strong>There are guys like Jim Carrey who had a miserable youth and created incredible comedy from that. But I had a great childhood in Ottawa, Canada.</p> <p><strong>James Brown showed me </strong>the responsibilities of being a band leader, with the rest of your group relying on you to keep the pay cheques coming in. Even if he was feeling down he didn’t let it affect his performance.</p> <p><strong>There is a universal life force that connects us all.</strong> I believe in an overhead cosmic godhead, a power that I draw on. But a church doesn’t have to be a church, it can just be one or more people in a room.</p> <p><strong>The death of John Belushi hit me hard. </strong>We had so much going on: a hit movie, a TV series. Suddenly I lost my partner. For a while afterwards I thought I might not come back from that.</p> <p><strong>Comedians today are more thoughtful than we were,</strong> and more grounded in real life. We did more absurdist stuff. But I love the younger guys – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jonah-hill\">Jonah Hill</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell\">Will Ferrell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a>. The torch has been passed.</p> <p><strong>I think of myself as a capitalist-socialist. </strong>I’m not very political, but if you had to take my leanings I’m left of centre. After Hurricane Katrina a lot of money was sucked away and never went to the rural police departments. My charity [the <a href=\"http://bluelineusa.org/\">Blue Line Foundation</a>] provides equipment and training – if you provide a car or a vest, you are tangibly making a difference.</p> <p><strong>My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy. </strong>You get on that and you don’t need a shrink. When you’re on the bike all you’re doing is concentrating on staying alive. You get into the rhythm of the road and it’s quite zen.</p> <p><strong>I’m a big fan of the British monarchy.</strong> I am lucky to have met the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward – they’re a living link with history. I look at Prince William and see a young guy with his heart and soul in the right place.</p> <p><strong>I believe in the continuous consciousness of the soul: </strong>when you die it goes off on a journey and becomes something else.

Kyle was the deadliest sniper in US military history, responsible for 160 confirmed kills during four tours of duty. Insurgents in Iraq called him the Devil of Ramadi, a monster in the shadows to be hated and feared. Comrades and supporters saw him as an American Hercules, a talismanic presence in the “war on terror”.</p> <p>Clint Eastwood stands squarely in the second camp. His gripping, incurious film gives the impression of having not so much been directed as dictated. It stares so fixedly down the rifle sight that it is finally guilty of tunnel vision.</p> <p>Is it possible to relish a drama but resent the way that it’s told? American Sniper (adapted from Kyle’s autobiography) offers a heartfelt salute to US muscle, a Green Berets for the war in Iraq; ringing with patriotic fervour and bullish male bonding. It’s lean, tough and tightly paced, darting from the rooftops of Falluja down through the ruined streets where the yellow dust swirls. But the film leaves a mass of casualties on either side of the frame.</p> <p>Bradley Cooper plays Kyle, a reformed tearaway, incensed by 9/11 and determined to defend “the greatest country on Earth”. He’s as broad as a barn and as clear-sighted as an eagle. He deals death from a distance and he makes the town safe for his men. Time and again Kyle heads back into the inferno, chasing a Syrian marksman (Sammy Sheik) who may just be his equal. Time and again he comes home with his blood pressure through the roof. His wife (Sienna Miller) has had enough of him; she’s contemplating divorce. So he sits in the garden with a thousand-yard stare. He is staring at the barbecue and seeing Iraq.</p> <p>All of which is engrossing, so far as it goes. It’s just that American Sniper is so conditioned by its first-person shooter aesthetic that it never widens its focus or pans left or right. Kyle’s wife is left hanging, while the war on Iraq is a just, noble cause. Meanwhile the Iraqis are reduced to a band of shadowy savages, darting like phantoms through the alleyways and led by a terrorist Satan who likes killing small boys with a drill. No doubt this sensibility reflects Kyle’s experience and if so, that’s fine. But I couldn’t help feeling that the film rather risks letting its man off the hook. In failing to interrogate the raw matter of Kyle’s book, it simply decides to print the legend instead.</p> <p>In one early scene, Kyle’s father tells him that the world is divided into three types: sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. Kyle sees himself as a sheepdog, a noble protector of the weak and the innocent, and it is clear that Eastwood does too. But is the world that simple? A different film (a better film) might have asked the wolves what they think, or at least wondered why the sheep behave as they do.</p> <p>American Sniper has no interest in that. The sole concession it makes is to acknowledge that the dog is sometimes traumatised by its heroic job of fending off wolves. This means it is therefore all the more deserving of a pat on the head, or a Silver Star medal, or a marble statue in its honour. In the absence of a monument, American Sniper does the job just as well.</p>","headline":"American Sniper review: Clint Eastwood’s heartfelt salute to US muscle in Iraq","trailText":"Unconcerned with

The high level of discord, he suggests, has provided him with dramatic material ever since.</p> <p>Leigh, 71, tells Yentob that his father, Dr Abe Leigh, was deeply opposed to the idea that he might become an artist or an actor. He forbade him his frequent habit of sketching visitors to the house and regarded him as a problem child because of his creative interests.</p> <p>“I was always drawing caricatures of people and he asked me to stop because he thought it might offend them,” Leigh will say. “Even the word ‘artist’ was very frightening to him, anathema. So the idea that I would be any sort of artist was terrifying to him”</p> <p>At the age of 14 Leigh was taken to see an NHS psychiatrist. “He [his father] decided I had something wrong with me mentally. So I went to see this extremely nice guy. And these were the first adult conversations I had had with another adult.”</p> <p>The psychiatrist told Leigh’s father that there was no mental problem with his son, but the news was not welcomed. “He said, ‘There is nothing wrong with him. He just doesn’t like being at home.’ My father was very angry and stopped me going. So I used to go along on my own to see him, and when my father found out about that he threatened to have him struck off the register.”</p> <p>The film director also recalls that both his parents were concerned about social appearances and about doing “the done thing”. The family moved from a working-class area of Salford out into the suburbs and their desire to conform became the centre of conflict. “I remember life at home becoming a battlefield every night,” Leigh says. “There were rows about nothing really. And what Dr Leigh was really doing, of course, was giving me a lifetime’s ammunition for my film-making. But the screaming matches were awful, terrible, horrifying to remember.”</p> <p>When the teenage Leigh, who went on to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, showed an interest in acting, his father urged him to shake off his ambitions as “the moonings of a stagestruck girly”.</p> <p>After failing all but three of his O-level exams, Leigh went to London to study acting in the early 1960s. He later won the role of a deaf mute in an episode of the popular TV series <em>Maigret</em>, but then lost interest in performing.</p> <p>Leigh remembers his nascent interest in film-making first taking hold when he was a boy in Salford attending a funeral, a Jewish wake or shiva held at a family home. As he watched the coffin being carried downstairs and listened to a family argument die down, Leigh tells Yentob he suddenly thought it would make a great film. “It was already a tragi-comic scene, you see,” he says.</p> <p>In London the director eventually attracted funding for his first film from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/albert-finney\" title=\"link to Guardian profile site\">the actor/director Albert Finney</a>, who was then in his mid-30s. Finney decided to use his newfound wealth to fund three films: one by Stephen Frears, who made <em>Gumshoe,</em> starring Finney; another by Tony Scott, called <em>Loving Memory</em>; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/01/mike-leigh-on-bleak-moments\" title=\"link to Leigh on this film\">Leigh’s <em>Bleak Moments</em></a>, which was hailed by the late American film critic Roger Ebert as a masterpiece.</p> <p>In the <em>Imagine</em> documentary, Leigh talks through his early career in theatre and television, before he was finally able to attract funding to make a feature film again, 17 years later, still using his trademark improvisational techniques.</p> <p>Leigh has two sons with his former wife, the actress Alison Steadman, and, according to one of them, he may not have an entirely encouraging attitude to the arts himself. Interviewed in 2009, his son Leo Leigh, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/17/leo-leigh-swansea-love-story1\" title=\"link to Guardian interview\">also a film-maker</a>, jokingly revealed that his father had warned him away from acting “from junior school.
