Thus in the near term one would expect inflation to start picking up. This will occur as the labour market tightens so that workers can start to bargain for higher wages.</p> <p>“This all points to inflation rising and an early initial rate rise. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/19/inflation-what-does-it-mean-for-you\">And yet this month’s inflation figure is down</a>. This could suggest that the economic picture is worse than the above analysis suggests.</p> <p>“However, the ONS highlights other reasons for the month’s figure: the late timing of the summer sales due to good weather mean clothes prices were unusually high in June this year and so the fall to July more pronounced than usual; the strengthening march of Aldi and Lidl, the supermarket discounters, has begun a retail price war lowering prices; the low ebb of the Eurozone has made sterling appreciate so that imported goods appear cheaper when priced in pounds.</p> <p>“If these reasons are correct then the low inflation figure is likely to be an aberration as the sales and price war effects run their course. One would expect UK economic growth to continue in September and wage growth to follow in due course. </p> <p>Which of these competing explanations applies is unclear.”</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Oh, the perils of economic forecasting....</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T15:14:10.166+01:00\">at 3.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53f4a4fce4b092330feea197\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T14:52:15.748+01:00\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In other news, Argentina’s plan to issue new local-law bonds to its creditors to resolve its default conundrum hasn’t been well received in the markets (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f45180e4b092330feea123\">see 8.59am for details</a>).</p> <p>The value of some Argentinian government bonds has fallen, suggesting investors see them as even riskier today.<br /></p> <p>Analysts are warning that the plan could leave creditors more exposed to the whims of the Argentinian government; even though, at present, they can’t be repaid at all, because a US judge has sided with vulture funds who demand full repayment on bonds which were defaulted on in 2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502082082458591232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Jefferies: “Execution risk should be high and initial participation quite low.&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Argentina?src=hash\">#Argentina</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Cancel (@DanCancel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502082082458591232\">August 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502081790807658497\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>JPMorgan: “It&#39;s also a poor option because restructured bondholders have to be willing to accept local custodian and capital control risk.”</p>&mdash; Daniel Cancel (@DanCancel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502081790807658497\">August 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53f49b7ae4b0ab8524dca283\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T14:16:45.616+01:00\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Larry Elliott: Bank is truffling through the data</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-11eee477-0818-4caf-afab-bfce5cf3d27a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408540474531/19f82151-7659-4373-8400-8a660dca249d-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Businessmen check their phones in the City of London on August 19, 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Businessmen checking their phones in the City of London.Photograph: CARL COURT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f45c05e4b0ab8524dca241\">Away from the drama of the 7-2 vote</a>, today’s minutes show that the Monetary Policy Committee is scrutinising every piece of economic data that comes their way.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2014/mpc1408.pdf\">“Immediate Policy Decision”</a> outlined the wide range of views about the amount of spare capacity remaining in the economy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f46096e4b0ab8524dca248\">As outlined earlier</a>, a majority of policymakers saw little inflationary risk – especially with wage growth still weak (<em>much to t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f48d7ce4b0ab8524dca27d\">he IoD’s chagrin</a></em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f48d7ce4b0ab8524dca27d\">)</a>.</p> <p><strong>Economics editor Larry Elliott </strong>reckons these seven MPC members they won’t be swayed anytime soon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been nothing in the recent data to make any of the seven MPC members voting to keep rates on hold change their minds.

This is the first time there wasn’t a unanimous decision in just over three years. The committee voted 9-0 in favour of leaving QE at £375bn.</p> <p>The two dissenters argued that “the degree of spare capacity had diminished sufficiently” and that a tightening labour market “created a prospect that wage growth would pick up”. They also noted that wages were a lagging indicator and “it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them”. Even after a 25bp rate rise they argued that “monetary policy would remain extremely supportive”. It would also help facilitate the MPCs “aspiration that the rises in Bank Rate should only be gradual”.<br /></p> <p>However, the majority still need a fair bit of convincing. The minutes stated that “for most members, there remained insufficient evidence of inflationary pressures to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate”. They felt that the rate of growth would moderate while inflation was expected to “reach the 2% target only at the end of the three-year forecast period”. They also cited weak wages and the possibility labour market slack may have been greater than previously thought. By delaying rate hikes it would “allow the expansion to become more entrenched”. Indeed, raising rates too early in the absence of wage rises could increase “the vulnerability of highly indebted households”, while also adding to upward pressure on sterling.<br /></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Knightley reckons, though, that Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty will remain in the minority for a while yet.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Yesterday’s low inflation numbers, the lack of wage growth and concerns about Eurozone growth – the UK’s largest trade partner, suggest that in the absence of upside activity data shocks the majority will continue to opt for the status quo in the next few months. Indeed, it currently looks more likely to be February when we see the first rate rise than our current published forecast of November.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T10:21:17.525+01:00\">at 10.21am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53f4671be4b01af8c1288dd6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T10:16:47.954+01:00\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This isn’t the first time that Martin Weale has called, in vain, for a rate rise.</strong> </p> <p>Back in 2011, he voted for a quarter-point rise, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/17/mpc-unanimously-held-interest-rates\">subsequently changed his mind as the world economy was rocked by the eurozone crisis</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/502020701424197632\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Martin Weale first voted for a UK Base Rate rise in January 2011 but stopped doing so in August 2011.

Rates have been held at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale's decision to vote for an increase in borrowing costs – revealed in <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Pages/mpc/pdf/2014/mpc1408.aspx\" title=\"\">the minutes of the August MPC meeting</a> – was the first time the committee has split on the issue since July 2011. The City was expecting a unanimous vote in favour of keeping rates on hold.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Samuel Tombs, Capital Economics</h2><p>\"The minutes of August's UK MPC meeting, revealing the first split vote on interest rates since July 2011, suggest that it would be foolish to rule out the possibility of a 2014 rate hike. External members Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty both voted to raise interest rates to 0.75%.</p><p>\"Nonetheless, data released since the MPC's meeting – not least the fall in inflation to 1.6% in July and the slower growth in employment – have eased the pressure on the committee to tighten quickly. Moreover, inflation still looks on track to ease much further than the MPC expects this year and to remain weak in 2015. For now, then, we still expect the first hike to come in February 2015.\"</p><p></p><h2>James Knightley, ING</h2><p>\"We suspect that Weale and McCafferty will remain in the minority for a while yet. Yesterday's low inflation numbers, the lack of wage growth and concerns about eurozone growth – the UK's largest trade partner – suggest that in the absence of upside activity data shocks the majority will continue to opt for the status quo in the next few months. Indeed, it currently looks more likely to be February when we see the first rate rise than our current published forecast of November.\"</p><p></p><h2>Marc Ostwald at ADM Investor Services International</h2><p>\"Weale and McCafferty were in effect arguing that relatively benign CPI forecasts should be overlooked, given that growth is robust and self-sustaining, and if the MPC wishes to be gradualist, then it would be better to go now to facilitate a shallow gradient to the rate hike path trajectory.</p><p>\"A majority vote for a rate hike still looks more like the first quarter of 2015, at the earliest. But at least Carney gets his wish on short rates re-establishing a higher risk of 'earlier rather than later', though sentiment on the rate outlook will doubtless continue to swing quite sharply.\"</p><p></p><h2>Jeremy Cook, World First</h2><p>\"It has taken three years, but the UK economy is in a strong enough place that some policymakers believe rate rises are now appropriate.</p><p>\"Both Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, the two most hawkish members of the monetary policy committee, voted for a 25-basis points increase. We take on board the dissenters' view that an increase in rates sooner allows for a more gradual glide path higher, but we cannot balance that up against the recent cut in wage growth to 1.25% from 2.5% at last week's Inflation Report, and yesterday's slip in inflation pressures.</p><p>\"Maybe the MPC thought that the rise in inflation seen in June would continue through the third quarter. That being said, a marker has been put down and we only need three more members of the MPC to switch allegiance and we will have higher rates in the UK.\"</p><p></p><h2>Christian Schulz, Berenberg</h2><p>\"Two dissenters mean that chances for a rate hike still this year may have increased a bit. There are caveats, however. (1) Dissenters do not always signal an imminent majority shift: there was a run of dissenting votes in 2011 as well, but the majority of the MPC stuck to the dovish course then. (2) Wage growth has slowed even more according to data releases since the meeting, with weekly earnings falling by 0.2% year-on-year in June. (3)&nbsp;Geopolitical risks have increased and affect the UK's largest trading partner, the eurozone. In our view, the probability for a first rate hike remains finely balanced, but the majority is likely to hold out until February next year. That would still be a bit before current market expectations.\"</p><p></p><h2>Alastair Winter at Daniel Stewart</h2><p>\"So, change is in the air after all! Over the last two months I have become increasingly convinced that it was merely a matter of months before the first rate hike came. The gap between the majority on the MPC and the so-called hawks has been, and still is, narrow. Martin Weale was already a suspect and now Ian McCafferty has 'come out'. Momentum is now building to an increase in November or December.\"</p>","headline":"Bank of England split on interest rates – what the economists say","trailText":"Two members of the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee voted for a 0.25-point rise in interest rates in August","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408528073407/interest-rates-006.jpg","wordcount":"755","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"445039588","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9423598","isPremoderated":"false","internalPageCode":"2144874","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-23T09:48:55Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/20/bank-england-split-interest-rates-economists-analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/aug/20/bank-england-split-interest-rates-economists-analysis","tags":[{"id":"business/bankofenglandgovernor","webTitle":"Bank of England","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/interest-rates","webTitle":"Interest rates","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/interest-rates","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/economicgrowth","webTitle":"Economic growth (GDP)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/economicgrowth","references":[]},{"id":"politics/economy","webTitle":"Economic policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/economy","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"business/economic-recovery","webTitle":"Economic recovery","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economic-recovery","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/economic-recovery","references":[]},{"id":"business/inflation","webTitle":"Inflation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/inflation","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"business/uk-unemployment-and-employment-statistics","webTitle":"UK unemployment and employment statistics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/uk-unemployment-and-employment-statistics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/uk-unemployment-and-employment-statistics","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-445039784","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408528065105/interest-rates-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","displayCredit":"true","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Carl Court","altText":"interest rates","suppliersReference":"DV1847170","height":"54","credit":"Carl Court/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Businessmen check their phones in the City of London as the 12-month inflation figure is revealed.

Thus in the near term one would expect inflation to start picking up.

This is the first time there wasn’t a unanimous decision in just over three years. The committee voted 9-0 in favour of leaving QE at £375bn.</p> <p>The two dissenters argued that “the degree of spare capacity had diminished sufficiently” and that a tightening labour market “created a prospect that wage growth would pick up”. They also noted that wages were a lagging indicator and “it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them”. Even after a 25bp rate rise they argued that “monetary policy would remain extremely supportive”. It would also help facilitate the MPCs “aspiration that the rises in Bank Rate should only be gradual”.<br /></p> <p>However, the majority still need a fair bit of convincing. The minutes stated that “for most members, there remained insufficient evidence of inflationary pressures to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate”. They felt that the rate of growth would moderate while inflation was expected to “reach the 2% target only at the end of the three-year forecast period”. They also cited weak wages and the possibility labour market slack may have been greater than previously thought. By delaying rate hikes it would “allow the expansion to become more entrenched”. Indeed, raising rates too early in the absence of wage rises could increase “the vulnerability of highly indebted households”, while also adding to upward pressure on sterling.<br /></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Knightley reckons, though, that Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty will remain in the minority for a while yet.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Yesterday’s low inflation numbers, the lack of wage growth and concerns about Eurozone growth – the UK’s largest trade partner, suggest that in the absence of upside activity data shocks the majority will continue to opt for the status quo in the next few months. Indeed, it currently looks more likely to be February when we see the first rate rise than our current published forecast of November.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T10:21:17.525+01:00\">at 10.21am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53f4671be4b01af8c1288dd6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T10:16:47.954+01:00\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This isn’t the first time that Martin Weale has called, in vain, for a rate rise.</strong> </p> <p>Back in 2011, he voted for a quarter-point rise, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/17/mpc-unanimously-held-interest-rates\">subsequently changed his mind as the world economy was rocked by the eurozone crisis</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/502020701424197632\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Martin Weale first voted for a UK Base Rate rise in January 2011 but stopped doing so in August 2011.

So the minutes of the latest Bank of England monetary policy meeting, released at 9.30am today, are eagerly awaited in the City and beyond.</p> <p>There’s a possibility that at least one member of the MPC broke ranks and voted to raise bank rate. This would be the first dissent since 2011. </p> <p>Alternatively, the nine-strong committee could have remained united in leaving borrowing costs unchanged, which would probably kibosh talk of an early rate rise. </p> <p>The details of the minutes should also show whether many committee members believe that most of the spare capacity in the UK economy has now been used up.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/19/uk-cpi-inflation-fall-lessens-interest-rate-rise\">Yesterday’s drop in inflation appears to have put a 2014 rate rise off the agenda</a> - but today’s minutes could change the picture again.... <br /></p> <p><strong>Stan Shamu </strong>of <strong>IG</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The focus will be on the BoE MPC meeting minutes, where the market will be looking for any signs that some members are getting hawkish.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week’s BoE inflation report showed there was “a wide range of views” over the amount of slack that still needs to be mopped up. However, Britain’s weak wage growth remained a major worry, so we’ll see what the MPC said about that too.</p> <p>Not too much else on the agenda today. We get the latest survey of the eurozone construction sector at 10am BST, and the CBI’s survey of UK industrial trends at 11am.</p> <p><em><strong>I’ll be tracking the main events through the day...</strong></em></p> </div>   </div>","headline":"Bank of England split 7-2 over interest rates - as it happened","trailText":"Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimity crumbles with two policymakers voting to raise interest rates to 0.75%, but first hike may still not come this year","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408514326483/ef3b5147-9bc7-4a44-9a50-1f42d280aad7-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"5112","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"445022017","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"53f438b5e4b0f23fdd9352de","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Graeme Wearden","displayRelativeTimes":"false","internalPageCode":"2144777","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-23T07:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live","tags":[{"id":"business/series/guardian-business-live","webTitle":"Guardian business live","description":"On our daily blog we provide live news coverage of the latest events in global financial markets, the economy and major corporate moves, with instant reaction and analysis from our own team of reporters and experts around the world ","type":"series","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/guardian-business-live","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/series/guardian-business-live","references":[]},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/debt-crisis","references":[]},{"id":"business/series/eurozone-crisis-live","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis live","description":"On our daily blog we report on the turmoil in the bond, stock and currency markets - as well as the political dramas at the heart of the eurozone crisis.","type":"series","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live","references":[]},{"id":"business/bankofenglandgovernor","webTitle":"Bank of England","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","references":[]},{"id":"business/economicgrowth","webTitle":"Economic growth (GDP)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/economicgrowth","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/blog","webTitle":"Business blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/minutebyminute","webTitle":"Minute by minutes","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/graemewearden","webTitle":"Graeme Wearden","r2ContributorId":"19202","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/7/1399476600504/Graeme-Wearden.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/7/1399476625361/Graeme-Wearden-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"wearden","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Graeme Wearden tracks the latest world business, economic and financial news in our daily liveblog.

There is of course some risk of a November 2014 move, given that cracks have now appeared in the MPC consensus.\"</p><p>Details of the split on the MPC came from the minutes of the committee's meeting on 7 August, which were released yesterday. The pound rose on the foreign exchanges amid speculation that a rate rise could now come earlier than expected, although some analysts pointed out that the economic news since early August had been less supportive of rapid action.</p><p>\"The minutes of August's MPC meeting, revealing the first split interest rate vote since July 2011, indicate that a 2014 rate hike cannot be ruled out,\" said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \"But the low inflation outlook suggests the odds are still in favour of a delay until early next year.\"</p><p>According to the minutes, the two dissenting MPC members said the state of the economy justified an immediate rise in the bank rate: \"These members noted that the continuing rapid fall in unemployment alongside survey evidence of tightening in the labour market created a prospect that wage growth would pick up. They noted that it was possible that wages were lagging behind developments in the labour market to some extent.</p><p>\"If that were true, wages might not start to rise until spare capacity in the labour market were fully used up. Since monetary policy, too, could be expected to operate only with a lag, it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank rate in advance of them.\"</p><p>Interest rates have been pegged at 0.5% – the lowest level in the Bank's 320-year history – since the deep recession during the winter of 2008-09, but McCafferty and Weale said that even after their proposed 0.25-point rise policy would be highly supportive of growth. An early rise would help ensure that increases in borrowing costs were gradual.</p><p>The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, had signalled a split on the MPC during last week's inflation report press conference, in which he said that there were differing views on the committee about the amount of slack still remaining in the economy following the deep recession of 2008-09.</p><p>But he was among the majority on the committee that decided \"there remained insufficient evidence of inflationary pressures to justify an immediate increase in Bank rate\".</p><p>Those voting for no change in August said \"growth was likely to ease a little as the boost from pent-up demand released by the easing in credit conditions and lifting of uncertainty faded. This would slow the pace at which slack was being eroded. Wage growth remained weak, suggesting that slack in the labour market might have been greater than previously thought.</p><p>\"In addition, increases in Bank rate well ahead of any pickup in wage and income growth risked increasing the vulnerability of highly indebted households. Finally, an unexpected increase in Bank rate might cause sterling to appreciate further, bearing down on inflation and further impeding UK economic rebalancing.\"</p>","headline":"Bank of England

The day Lehman Brothers went down was the cut-off point between conventional monetary policy – moving official interest rates in baby steps to keep inflation low – and unconventional monetary policy.</p><p>Interest rates came down in big leaps to barely above zero. Central banks bought long-term government bonds and risky assets, providing money in return in the process known as quantitative easing. Forward guidance embedded the idea that borrowing would remain cheap for a long time. Schemes, such as the Bank of England's Funding for Lending, were introduced to get the commercial banks lending once more. The rule book was torn up.</p><p>Almost six years on, the post-Lehman regime remains in place. The perceived wisdom among central banks is that unconventional monetary policy prevented a deep recession turning into a second Great Depression and that unwinding the emergency measures too quickly would threaten what is still a tentative global recovery.</p><p>A new working paper by two International Monetary Fund economists does not challenge the idea that things could have turned really nasty had it not been for the slashing of interest rates, QE and all the other wheezes dreamed up by central banks. Even so, the paper by Frederic Lambert and Kenichi Ueda (The effects of unconventional monetary policies on bank soundness) makes uncomfortable reading.</p><p>It argues that the policies pursued by central banks since 2008 have not made commercial banks more profitable.  But they have made banks riskier and more likely to delay repairs to their balance sheets. \"Unconventional monetary policy is often assumed to benefit banks. However, we find little supporting evidence. Rather, we find some evidence for heightened medium-term risks\", Lambert and Ueda say.</p><p>The implications are clear. One of the side effects of unconventional monetary policy is that banks are encouraged by low interest rates to seek out higher yielding – and riskier – investments, while QE gives them more scope to do so. The risks increase the longer the unconventional policies remain in place.</p><p>Lambert and Ueda do not speak for the IMF, which has been a keen supporter of unconventional policies. Even so, this is an important paper. It suggests that the Fund and the world's leading central banks need an exit strategy from the policies of the past six years. Otherwise, they could be storing up big problems for the future.</p>","headline":"Central banks need exit strategy from post-crisis policies","trailText":"<p>IMF economists argue monetary policies

It shouldn't have been since the explanation was simple: the summer sales came late this year.</p><p>Clothing and footwear retailers cut their prices by 5.7% in July, a heftier discount than the 3.2% in July 2013. By contrast, Primark, Topshop, Kurt Geiger and all the other big names of the high street cut their prices by less this June than they did in the same month of 2013.</p><p>As a result, inflation was a bit higher than might have been expected in June but a bit lower in July. The annual increase in the cost of living as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) has settled in a narrow range just below the government's 2% target; in the past seven months it has never been higher than 1.9% and never lower than 1.6%.</p><p>Even with July's drop in inflation, prices are still rising faster than earnings, which are going up at an annual rate of 0.6%. At the start of the year there was a lot of talk about how 2014 was going to be the year of the pay rise. That now looks unlikely. Living standards will carry on falling deep into the autumn even if wages do start to pick up.</p><p>Some City analysts think 2014 will also be the year of the interest rate rise. That, too, is starting to look questionable given not just the weakness of CPI inflation but also the lack of any real price pressure in the pipeline. The producer prices index, a guide to the costs paid by manufacturers and the price of goods leaving factory gates, shows that the drop in fuel and raw material costs together with tight control of pay is allowing firms to cut tariff prices.</p><p>An interest rate rise by the end of the year – November being the likeliest date – should not be ruled out, but it will be on the basis of what the Bank of England's monetary policy committee thinks is going to happen to inflation rather than what is actually happening. Inflation is below target; earnings are going up by just 0.6% on average; oil prices are falling; a strong pound is reducing the cost of imports. Nothing there to get the alarm bells ringing.</p><p>The sting in the tail from the inflation figures is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/19/rail-fares-above-inflation-rise-january\" title=\"\">rail travellers could see fares rise by an average of 3.5% in the New Year</a>. That's because the government's formula, suspended by George Osborne for 2014, is for fares to go up by one percentage point more than inflation as measured by the July Retail Prices Index, which stood at 2.5%. Note how the government uses the RPI -– no longer thought reliable enough to be considered an official statistic by the ONS – as the yardstick for rail fares but the lower CPI to uprate benefits and pensions. The party that pledges to put an end to this scam will pick up plenty of votes in commuterland.</p>","headline":"UK inflation figures - say goodbye to your pay rise","trailText":"<p>It was thought

Clothing and footwear prices fell by 5.7% between June and July, compared with a smaller fall of 3.2% during the same period last year. Prices were slashed on a wide range of items, including trousers, coats and jumpers.</p><p>Alcohol prices, the cost of some financial services including bank overdraft charges, and food also contributed to the fall.</p><p>A Treasury spokesman gave credit for the fall in inflation to the government. \"The government's long-term economic plan is working, with today marking the seventh consecutive month that inflation has been below the Bank of England's two per cent target.</p><p>\"But the effects of the great recession are still being felt and so we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living, including cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty and reducing the costs of childcare. The job is not yet done so the government will go on making the realistic assessment of what needs to be done to deliver a brighter economic future.\"</p><p>The news was not all good for consumers, who face average rail fare rises of 3.5% in 2015. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/19/rail-fares-above-inflation-rise-january\" title=\"\">The July inflation rate on the retail prices index (RPI) measure is used to calculate rail fare rises</a>, and dropped to 2.5% last month from 2.6% in June. Increases are traditionally capped at RPI+1% – although train operators may raise fares on some routes by an extra 2%. That means some rail fares could increase by up to 5.5%.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/aug/18/mark-carney-bank-of-england-rate-rise-timing-uncertainty\" title=\"\">Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has given mixed messages in recent weeks</a> on the likely timing of a first increase in interest rates, which have left been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009. Economists said lack of inflationary pressure in the UK, coupled with weak wage growth, made a rate hike in 2014 less likely.</p><p>James Knightley, economist at ING, said: \"On the face of it this supports an on-hold stance from the Bank of England. The combination of sterling strength (making imported goods cheaper), along with weak wage growth and lower energy prices, which are limiting business cost growth, means inflation looks set to remain contained for now.</p><p>\"This further eases the pressure on the Bank of England to consider near-term interest rate rises and pushes the balance more in favour of a delay to rate hikes versus our current November official view for the first policy tightening move.\"</p><p>Despite below target inflation, household budgets remain under pressure because wage growth has lagged behind the inflation rate for the vast majority over the past six years.</p><p>Pay growth including bonuses fell by 0.2% between April and June compared with a year earlier. Stripping out bonuses, pay was 0.6% – less than a third of June's 1.9% inflation rate.</p><p>Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: \"While this fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, the squeeze on working people continues.\"</p><p>The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after the July data was published, as investors interpreted it as a sign that rates would stay on hold into 2015.</p><p>The pound fell to $1.6634, its lowest in more than eight months, while the euro rose 0.4% to 80.25p.</p>","headline":"UK inflation fall to 1.6% lessens likelihood of interest

Elsewhere, the likes of Mango, Warehouse, H&amp;M and Zara have all got summer clothes on bargain rails.</p><p>It would be no surprise to shoppers in the Bullring that the biggest contribution to a dive in the rate of inflation last month was a 5.7% decline in the price of clothing and footwear. The cuts helped drive down the consumer prices index from 1.9% in June to 1.6% in July, which in turned reduced the prospect of an interest rate rise before the end of 2014.</p><p>Clothing prices fall in the summer as retailers try to offload seasonal stock before the autumn. One of the main reasons the bargains were so tempting last month was because strong demand for summer clothing during the fine weather led stores to delay offering deals.</p><p>\"Retailers had the perfect summer. There was an early start to the warm weather and then it was pretty constant. Unless they made very poor buying decisions they should have much less stock left on the shelves which they need to offload,\" says Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at retail trends agency WGSN.</p><p>So the bargains and the dip in inflation may be short lived, which is not good news for shoppers faced with stagnant wage growth and the threat of steeper housing costs when interest rates rise.</p><p>But Bryan Roberts of analysts Kantar Retail points to evidence of an entrenched trend for cheaper clothing even among full-priced items. In M&amp;S, for instance, there is a range of simple long-sleeved T-shirts prominently displayed, priced at £8. \"They're really making an effort on the price of these basic items but I bet they don't cost that much in Primark,\" he says.</p><p>This is an example of the Aldi and Lidl effect being replicated in the nation's clothes stores. The threat of losing shoppers to the German discounters is helping to drive down prices on everyday foods such as bread and milk at the supermarket chains, which contributing to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/21/food-spending-falls-price-wars-real-wages-drop\" title=\"\">first-ever annual decline in food spending last month</a>. Food prices fell by 0.2% month-on-month.</p><p>The success of Primark and supermarket clothing ranges continues to put a brake on any price rises among the traditional high-street fashion stores. Even at the Birmingham branch of Selfridges there are large areas devoted to Primark alongside more upmarket brands such as Karen Millen and Ted Baker.</p><p>This week, Lidl opened a new front in its war with the supermarkets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/20/lidl-launches-womens-clothing-discount\" title=\"\">with a small range of fashion items</a> including jeans, faux leather jackets for as little as £14.99 and ankle boots, priced very keenly compared with rivals' own-label ranges and well below the likes of M&amp;S.</p><p>\"The timing of the sales has been a major contributor to deflation this summer but over the long term ongoing levels of competition in the high street are not going to get any easier,\" says Roberts. \"People are going to have to sharpen their pricing a bit more.\"</p><p>Price falls are the result ofdue to a combination of factors including a drop in global cotton prices as well as lower manufacturing costs owing to downward pressure on wage rises in China, where many UK-sold clothes are made. There is also the  pound's strength against the dollar, the currency via which much of the retail trade operateswhich makes clothing imports cheaper.</p><p>At the same time, shoppers are nervous about spending their money despite the upturn in the UK economy as wage rises have been outpaced by the rate of inflation for several years – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/13/fall-uk-wages-bittersweet-rising-employment\" title=\"\">wages fell for the first time since 2009 between April and June</a>. Job security remains an issue for many, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/20/self-employment-uk-highest-level\" title=\"\">record self-employment</a> pointing to the fragility of the jobs market.</p><p>\"Even if you have got a decent level of disposable income, you're being a lot more cautious about balancing out needs and wants,\" says Roberts. \"Money that traditionally would've been spent on discretionary purchases like a new outfit or cosmetics has been diverted to telecoms and technology. People are shelling out £30 to £40 a month on mobile phone fees.\"</p><p>In Birmingham, shoppers who are confident about spending are hard to find. Wayne and Caroline Davey and their two sons think very hard about what they buy. Caroline Davey says: \"We are teachers and we have had no pay rise for years. Inflation has gone up and our wages have stayed still and that has had a significant impact.\"</p><p>Retired couple Terry and Carol Fallows say they have also changed the way they shop, using the internet to seek out the best prices on big ticket items they want as low interest rates mean they must carefully guard their savings. Carol Fallows says: \"Instead of just going to one supermarket we go to several different ones because the prices are so different. In the past I used to mainly shop in Asda and Sainsbury's, now it's Morrisons and Aldi and sometimes Asda.\"</p><p>Retailers say that kind of approach is the main factor which will continue to put a brake on prices well beyond the summer sales season.</p><p>Kate Bostock, who now runs small fashion chain Coast but formerly worked at Next, M&amp;S and George at Asda, says: \"The pressure is on to keep prices affordable, and that all goes back to the consumer and what they are prepared to pay. There's no question that competition remains strong.\"</p><p>Shoppers may have little more to spend but in Birmingham, the rising competition is there for all to see. Behind the Bullring, a forest of cranes marks the building site for a planned new indoor shopping mall called Grand Central, which will include a John Lewis department store and will add 450,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft of new shopping space. As in the rest of the country, sSomeone is going to lose out.</p><p>Roberts says: \"We are reaching the realisation that there are too many stores and too much stuff so the only logical outcome of that is slashed prices.\"</p><p>That could be good news for shoppers but tricky times for the economy – and retailers in particular.</p>","headline":"A window on discount Britain shows a long hot

On one side are the retailers keen on selling as much as they can at full price in order to boost profit margins. On the other side are the consumers, intent on winkling the best possible deal out of the big chains.</p><p>Judging by the latest inflation figures, it is a game consumers are winning hands down – especially when it comes to clothing and footwear. The latest set of inflation figures showed the headline measure of the annual cost of living falling from 1.9% in June to 1.6% in July. More than two-thirds of this drop was the result of a 5.7% fall in the cost of clothing and footwear, which accounts for £7 of every £100 spent by the average consumer.</p><p>There are markdowns every year at New Look, Jigsaw and Clarks. But this year's drop was significantly bigger than the 3.2% decline in July 2013. Last month's bargains followed a small rise in clothing and footwear prices in June as retailers sought to discover whether more than a year of solid growth and falling unemployment had made consumers willing to pay a bit more for their suits, dresses and shoes.</p><p>They got their answer. Clothing and footwear sales fell by more than 1% between May and June, according to the Office for National Statistics. Shoppers kept their purses and wallets closed in anticipation that retailers would take a look at racks full of unsold summer fashions and hit the panic button. As prices fell, consumers started to spend a bit more, although the level of clothing and footwear sales in July did not make up all the ground lost in June.</p><p>For retailers, there is a twofold message from this summer's trading patterns. The first is that consumers still do not feel all that flush, perhaps unsurprisingly given the continued squeeze on real incomes. The second is that even when living standards do start to rise, it will still be hard to push up profit margins. Consumers, young and old, are increasingly savvy. They know when to sit tight.</p>","headline":"Consumers are winning a game of cat and mouse with high street shops","trailText":"<p>Clothing and footwear prices dropped 5.7% in July as shoppers held out for the best possible deal</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"13","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/22/1408714576027/Oxford-Street-sales-006.jpg","wordcount":"351","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"445268364","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9434194","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Larry Elliott, economics editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-08-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2146329","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-25T13:39:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/22/consumers-game-cat-and-mouse-high-street-shops","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/aug/22/consumers-game-cat-and-mouse-high-street-shops","tags":[{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/inflation","webTitle":"Inflation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/inflation","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/larryelliott","webTitle":"Larry Elliott","rcsId":"GNL001696","r2ContributorId":"15965","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749335083/LarryElliott.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733742341/LarryElliott.png","firstName":"","lastName":"elliott","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Larry Elliott is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics\">economics</a> editor and has been with the paper since 1988</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/larryelliott","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/larryelliott","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-445311942","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/22/1408714568409/Oxford-Street-sales-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","displayCredit":"true","source":"Georgie Gillard/Associated N/Rex","altText":"Oxford Street sales","suppliersReference":"3932895a","height":"54","credit":"Georgie Gillard/Associated N/Rex","caption":"Summer sales on Oxford Street, central London.
