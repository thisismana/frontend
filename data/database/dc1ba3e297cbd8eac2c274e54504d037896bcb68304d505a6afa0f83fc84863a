funding</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Australian women’s road cycling has received a timely and crucial boost with the launch of a new domestic team.<br /></p> <p>The High5 Dream Team will compete in the National Road Series and will aim to help riders bridge the gap to professional racing in Europe.</p> <p>It will be a local super team that should dominate domestic racing.</p> <p>The team is the brainchild of former top rider Rochelle Gilmore, who already owns and manages the British-based Wiggle Honda professional squad.</p> <p>Donna Rae Szalinski, one of Australian cycling’s most respected coaches, will work with the nine riders.</p> <p>Friday’s team launch comes in the wake of controversy over the suspension of a Cycling Australia (CA) women’s development program.</p> <p>It will not run this year as CA tries to recover from a financial crisis and a complete overhaul of how the organisation operates.</p> <p>Several leading women’s riders have objected to the decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c793a13229e114666f06699b6553b0e8536684a\"> <img

</figure>  <p>Gilmore came up with the idea of a top-flight domestic team after discussions with CA during last year’s world road championships.</p> <p>“I said ‘listen, I have 15 women wanting to ride for my team (Wiggle Honda), can you please give me some advice on who has the talent, who we should be looking at’,” Gilmore told reporters.</p> <p>“During these conversations, I realised there was a question mark over what was happening at CA the following year - the funding situation might not be as strong as it has been.</p> <p>“There was a pool of these athletes who CA have recommended - if we can do something, get some funding, let’s get them together.”</p> <p>“(They) are the best that Australia has who aren’t already in pro teams.”</p> <p>Gilmore has also committed to sending six riders to Europe for a six-week training and racing trip.</p> <p>“That was what the national program was doing in the past,” she said.</p> <p>Gilmore added that the six riders would not necessarily come from the High5 squad.</p> <p>One of the new team’s leaders is Kimberley Wells, who on Wednesday night regained the national criterium championship.</p> <p>The team members are Wells, Rebecca Wiasak, Jess Mundy, Georgia Baker, Tessa Fabri, Kendelle Hodges, Ellen Skerett and Sam de Riter.<br /></p> <p>Lauren Perry will also be involved as an associate scholarship holder.</p> <p>“What we’re going to do is create an environment for these athletes where they have the best equipment, the best everything,” Gilmore said.</p> <p>“We will ask the world of them in return as professional athletes.</p> <p>“These athletes will be supported better than any other domestic-based athletes have been supported before.”</p>","headline":"New Australian women's cycling team High5 Dream Team

Cavendish has indicated he is unlikely to race at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The 29-year-old, who missed out on medals at both the 2008 and 2012 Olympics in Beijing and London, told BBC Sport his obligations with the Etixx-Quick Step road racing team are likely to prevent him from being in the shape required to qualify for Great Britain’s team.</p> <p>“It’s not 100% I’m not doing the Olympics but it’s difficult,” he said. “It probably won’t happen, if I’m honest. I’ve got a road job.”</p> <p>Cavendish, who is entering the final year of his contract with the Belgian team he joined from Team Sky in 2013, has long said his commitment to his employers had to come before his Olympic ambitions.</p> <p>Adding to his uncertainty over Rio is his recognition that the road race course may not suit a sprinter, given that it includes three laps over a lengthy climb as well as a cobblestone section, while he does not have the time to dedicate to track cycling.</p> <p>“The [course for the] road race doesn’t suit me,” Cavendish said. “The time trial, well, I’m not a time triallist. And as for the track, the UCI has segregated track and road cycling completely.”</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/08/bradley-wiggins-new-team-sky\" title=\"\"> Sir Bradley Wiggins confirmed plans to launch a new cycling team</a> when his Sky contract expires in April, which will race at the continental level while following a programme designed to allow the riders involved – Wiggins included – to get in shape for the track races in Rio.</p> <p>Cavendish, who competed alongside Wiggins in the Madison in Beijing, believes that is a reflection of the changes that no longer make it possible for cyclists to perform at elite levels on both the road and the track.</p> <p>“You have to do what Sir Bradley Wiggins is doing and quit road cycling to be able to qualify for it,” he said. “It’s killing track cycling, because you never get the road stars doing track anymore. Track cycling is going to die, particularly on the endurance side. As a British athlete I want to do the Olympics but it’s hard. I can’t do it on the road, can’t do it in the time trial and on the track there’s just no way to qualify without quitting the road.”</p>","headline":"Mark Cavendish likely to miss Rio 2016 Olympics due to road commitments","trailText":"Mark Cavendish has indicated he is unlikely to race at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and criticised the UCI for ‘segregating’ track and road cycling","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420752129285/Mark-Cavendish-006.jpg","wordcount":"385","commentable":"false","byline":"Press Association","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-11T21:25:23Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/08/mark-cavendish-rio-2016-olympics-track-road-cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2015/jan/08/mark-cavendish-rio-2016-olympics-track-road-cycling","tags":[{"id":"sport/markcavendish","webTitle":"Mark Cavendish","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/markcavendish","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/markcavendish","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympic-games-2016","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2016","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games-2016","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympic-games-2016","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympic-games","webTitle":"Olympic Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympic-games","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"a2b1ac21838d8cafc8582c1f166c7cc9e5db2b8b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420752135799/Mark-Cavendish-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420752135799/Mark-Cavendish-011.jpg","source":"PA","photographer":"Martin Rickett","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Mark Cavendish","suppliersReference":"CYCLING_Cavendish_204164.JPG","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA","caption":"Mark Cavendish says he is unlikely to compete at RIo 2016 because of his road commitments with Etixx-Quick Step.

The team is track-based and we have got a lot of the guys from the track programme in there so that we can stay and race and train together all year round. We can get exactly what we need in terms of achieving the end goal, which is winning the team pursuit in Rio.”</p> <p>The UCI confirmed three days ago that the team had been given a continental licence – two levels below Team Sky – under the name Team Wiggins and that its team director would be the former professional Simon Cope.</p> <p>That makes them the sixth British squad to be registered in that category, and it will enable them to ride major events such as the Tour de Yorkshire, Tour of Britain and RideLondon. They are also expected to ride domestic races such as the Tour Series criteriums while Wiggins’s name and reputation should earn them invitations to events abroad.</p> <p>A news release from the team stated that further details of the team’s bike and equipment suppliers, colours, logo, and team jersey will be unveiled in spring this year, together with the team’s racing calendar. It was also confirmed that Wiggins will attempt the world hour record later this year, in the new team’s colours.</p> <p>Wiggins’s team-mates from the start of May will be his fellow team pursuiters Andy Tennant, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/02/owain-doull-great-britain-cycling-europcar-track-olympics-rio-2016\" title=\"\">Owain Doull</a>, Jon Dibben, Mark Christian and the London gold medallist Steven Burke, together with Daniel Patten, who raced in the US in 2014, the Olympic academy rider Michael Thompson and the GB mountain bike academy rider Ian Paton.</p> <p>Burke, Tennant, Doull and Christian all formed part of the Great Britain squad that won the gold medal in the team pursuit at the London World Cup in December; the fifth rider from London, Ed Clancy, has opted to remain with his trade squad of long-standing, Team JLT-Condor.</p> <p>“Cycling has given me everything,” said Wiggins in a press release. “Now I want to build something to inspire kids and to reach all those people who might be on the fringes of the sport. We’ve seen cycling grow in popularity over the years and I want WIGGINS to inspire a new generation of cyclists.”</p> <p>Earlier this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/05/bradley-wiggins-team-sky-contract-extension\" title=\"\">it was confirmed that Wiggins had signed a final contract with Team Sky to take him up to the end of April</a>, enabling him to make his attempt on Paris-Roubaix on 12 April before transferring to his new team and attempting the hour record.</p> <p>This has been broken twice since the UCI rejigged the rules last year, and currently stands to the Austrian Matthias Brändle. There are likely to be at least three or four attempts – one scheduled by the Briton Alex Dowsett for 28 February – before Wiggins gets his chance.</p> <p>There have been rumours that Wiggins might try for the record in Mallorca, but he said on Thursday that his venue of choice would be in London at the Olympic velodrome. “It would have to be really,” he said. “The plan is to do it in June. Again, the next 12-year-old might come along that may be inspired by watching the hour record like I was inspired watching Chris Boardman win the gold in Barcelona.”</p>","headline":"Bradley Wiggins unveils new team to be sponsored by Sky","trailText":"Details have emerged of the new team to be set up by Sir Bradley Wiggins which he will lead when his contract with Team Sky closes at the end of April","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/1/8/1420714155823/bradley-wiggins-006.jpg","wordcount":"669","commentable":"true","byline":"William Fotheringham","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-11T11:00:07Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/08/bradley-wiggins-new-team-sky","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2015/jan/08/bradley-wiggins-new-team-sky","tags":[{"id":"sport/bradleywiggins","webTitle":"Sir Bradley Wiggins","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/bradleywiggins","references":[]},{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"fotheringham","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"ab336b986cd2c5c2c7b9fcf9b53a69e97dcafcc1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/1/8/1420714162824/bradley-wiggins-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/1/8/1420714162824/bradley-wiggins-011.jpg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bryn Lennon","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"bradley wiggins","suppliersReference":"499561615","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images","caption":"Sir Bradley Wiggins's new team will be called WIGGINS and is expected to ride domestic races such as the Tour Series criteriums.

I’ve been with Team Sky from the start. I’ve had some amazing experiences during that time and I hope there are a few more to come.</p> <p>“Paris-Roubaix is a special race for me and I’m determined to give it another go in Team Sky colours. It’s one of the toughest races in the calendar and my aim is to improve on my finish last year. After that I can focus fully on preparing for the Rio Olympics in 2016.”</p> <p>Wiggins’s goal is to finish his career at Rio, if possible riding the team pursuit for Great Britain. Along the way he is likely to make an attempt on the World Hour Record, which has been provisionally pencilled in for the end of June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/26/bradley-wiggins-world-hour-record-2015\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian in August</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/13/bradley-wiggins-paris-roubailles-cycling\" title=\"\">Wiggins finished ninth in Paris-Roubaix in 2014</a>, the best performance by a Tour de France winner since Greg LeMond finished in the same position in 1992.</p> <p>No Tour victor has won the cobbled Classic since Bernard Hinault in 1981. “It would be incredible [to win], but I’m not quite thinking at the moment about that,” he told Sky Sports. ”I’m just concentrating on the training and the process of getting there. Just to be part of that race and to be there again in the final would be an amazing way to go out. It was an incredible feeling last year to just be there with some of those guys that were there in the final and to do that again would be an amazing thing.”</p> <p>Wiggins has raced for Team Sky since the team’s inception in 2010 and has been their most successful rider since then, winning the Tour de France, Dauphiné Libéré, Tour of Romandie and Paris-Nice “race to the sun” in 2012, along with the world time-trial championship and Tour of California in 2014.</p> <p>He also held the pink leader’s jersey at the Giro d’Italia, and the leader’s jersey at the Vuelta a España for the British team, and won races as diverse as the prologue time trial in the Giro, the Tour of Britain and British national titles at road race and time trial while wearing their distinctive black jersey with light blue stripe.</p> <p>After his contract with Sky finishes at the end of April, Wiggins is expected to transfer to a new squad registered at UCI Continental level, provisionally entitled “Team Wiggo”, which is being set up to enable him and other prospective Great Britain team pursuiters to race on the road while preparing for Rio.</p> <p>Details on “Team Wiggo” are sparse at present, although much of the lineup has filtered out. It will include pursuiters Owain Doull, Mark Christian, Andy Tennant and Steven Burke, with Jon Dibben another possible. The directeur sportif will be former professional Simon Cope, who has been involved with the Great Britain team for several years. It seems likely that it will be backed by Sky, although UCI rules mean it cannot take Sky’s name as its official title. There are indications that the team may race for the first time without Wiggins – in the Challenge Mallorca at the end of January.</p>","headline":"Bradley Wiggins signs final contract extension with Team Sky","trailText":"Sir Bradley Wiggins has signed a contract extension with Team Sky up to and including the Paris-Roubaix race in April 2015<br />","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/1/5/1420457061007/Bradley-Wiggins-006.jpg","wordcount":"607","commentable":"true","byline":"William Fotheringham","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-08T11:25:48Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/05/bradley-wiggins-team-sky-contract-extension","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2015/jan/05/bradley-wiggins-team-sky-contract-extension","tags":[{"id":"sport/bradleywiggins","webTitle":"Sir Bradley Wiggins","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/bradleywiggins","references":[]},{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"fotheringham","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"f0566365c1074a0161b3401607fbd1c072c0ca69","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/1/5/1420457069051/Bradley-Wiggins-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/1/5/1420457069051/Bradley-Wiggins-011.jpg","source":"PA","photographer":"Andrew Matthews","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Bradley Wiggins","suppliersReference":"CYCLING_Tour_of_Britain_133934.J","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA","caption":"Bradley Wiggins said 'Paris-Roubaix is a special race for me and I’m determined to give it another go in Team Sky colours.'

Tasmanian aims to put this year’s woes behind him by winning the 11 January Australian road title at Buninyong, near Ballarat.</p> <p>His main targets next year will be to lead the powerful Sky team at the Giro in May and then support his good friend Chris Froome in July at the Tour de France.</p> <p>“I’d love to compete in the Giro as the new Australian champion,” Porte said. “My health is back where it needs to be and I want to lead in a grand tour and the Giro is the target for me. Nothing is a given yet, but it looks like that will be my race.</p> <p>“Chris has also had an up and down season and it’s his goal to go back and win the Tour de France. I’d love to be there supporting him, but I’m also going to take my opportunities next season.”</p> <p>Porte’s 2014 campaign started brilliantly when he finished third behind Simon Gerrans and Cadel Evans in a pulsating road race at the Buninyong nationals.</p> <p>He then won the prestigious Willunga stage on the way to fourth overall at the Tour Down Under.</p> <p>After a promising second overall in February at Spain’s Ruta del Sol stage race, Porte had to pull out midway through the Tirreno-Adriatico because of illness.</p> <p>He would eventually abandon his plans to ride at the Giro.</p> <p>Porte then took over leadership of the Sky team when Froome had to pull out of the Tour de France. At one point he was third overall in the race, but again ill health dogged him and he finished 23rd.</p> <p>Porte, who also finished third behind Gerrans at the 2012 nationals, will not have to worry about the Orica-GreenEDGE rider this year.</p> <p>Gerrans broke his collarbone in a pre-Christmas training crash, ruling him out of title defences at the road nationals and the Tour Down Under.</p> <p>His absence clearly opens the race up for Porte and Evans, who will retire in early February.</p> <p>“I love the Buninyong course and I don’t think that GreenEDGE has got quite the numbers they’ve had in other years,” he said.</p> <p>“It would be very nice to have a podium like we had this year and anybody that wins on that circuit is a worthy winner.</p> <p>“So it’s a big goal to go there and try and take that jersey.”</p>","headline":"Richie Porte targeting Giro and Australian national championships","trailText":"Australian cyclist hopes to lead British Sky team at first grand tour of the year and is optimistic about chances of doing it while wearing national champion’s jersey","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419913991599/ac68c306-49d2-4084-8751-343f389f46d3-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"413","commentable":"true","byline":"Australian Associated Press","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-02T15:30:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/30/richie-porte-targeting-giro-and-australian-national-championships","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/30/richie-porte-targeting-giro-and-australian-national-championships","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"ecf040c02b5d36b1f11f8c86e4f1952760b12c01","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419913991127/ac68c306-49d2-4084-8751-343f389f46d3-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419913991127/ac68c306-49d2-4084-8751-343f389f46d3-220x132.jpeg","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Lionel Bonaventure","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Richie Porte","suppliersReference":"DV1821371","height":"132","credit":"Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Richie Porte rides in the pack during the 10th stage of the 2014 Tour de France.

of top UK swimmers and third of Team Sky cyclists suffer from some form of condition, especially exercise-induced asthma","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>It’s not unknown for elite sports people to have asthma – <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/asthma/Pages/PaulaRadcliffe.aspx\" title=\"\">Paula Radcliffe</a> and <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/scholes-my-asthma-torment-1147753\" title=\"\">Paul Scholes</a> are among well-known British examples – but the good news for wheezy children wistfully dreaming of a sporting career is that research is increasingly uncovering just how many asthmatics there are in top-level sport.</p> <p>In fact, tThe figures can seem astonishing. <a href=\"http://www.kent.ac.uk/sportsciences/staff/Academic/j-dickinson.html\" title=\"\">John Dickinson from Kent university</a>, a world expert on asthma in sport, who has tested all 33 UK-based swimmers from the British Swimming squad found 70% have some form of asthma. A similar test on the cyclists from Team Sky revealed about a third are prone to a wheeze, against a national asthma rate of about 8% to 10%.</p> <p>The picture is, inevitably, a bit more complicated. While a few have so-called classic asthma, the largely allergy-triggered constriction of the bronchial tubes that usually begins in childhood, Dickinson tests for what is known as exercise-induced asthma, or EIA.</p> <p>The symptoms are similar – a contraction of the airways brings the feeling of a tight chest – but instead it is caused by rapid and heavy breathing during exertion. Atmospheric factors can exacerbate this. The chlorine environment in pools is believed to be part of the reason for the very high EIA levels for high-level swimmers, while cold air can also be a trigger, boosting numbers for road cyclists and the likes of cross-country skiers, with about half of the latter group having the condition.</p> <p>Dickinson, head of the respiratory clinic at Kent’s School of Sport and Exercise Science, says he nonetheless views it as asthma: “It depends which respiratory consultant you talk to on whether you put these athletes on a spectrum of asthma, or whether you think that’s purely down to them exercising really hard in a certain environment, and if you take them out of that environment they’re fine. It’s a grey zone. But my argument is it’s a form of asthma.”</p> <p>The test he uses involves athletes being asked to breathe a very dry air mixture for six minutes at high ventilation, with their lung function tested before and after. The asthma-induced fall can be dramatic, as high as 40%, Dickinson says: “Athletes with asthma can feel bad if perceiving their lung function has dropped. They get used to pushing themselves, get used to feeling out of breath and being able to control that.”</p> <p>The phenomenon of EIA is not new, with some mass screening programmes beginning before the 2008 Beijing Olympics due to concerns about pollution. But tests like Dickinson’s are helping to uncover the scale of it, while revised anti-doping regulations are helping to treat the symptoms.</p> <p>In the past, asthma medications had to be cleared with doping authorities, via medical certificates. Now, any athlete can use common bronchio-dilating inhalers like salbuthamol so long as they do not exceed a certain dose.From his work with cyclists, Dickinson says, surprising numbers carry inhalers in the back pockets of their jerseys: “Cognitively, the inhaler can give you the confidence to push yourself that little bit more. Sometimes a rider will know a climb is coming, so they take a couple of puffs.”</p> <p>Jonathan Leeder, a physiologist with the English Institute of Sport, says many athletes see their symptoms disappear with medication: “However, when medication isn’t effective to alleviate wheezing or breathlessness during exercise, other strategies can be used, like inspiratory muscle training, breathing technique exercises and postural work.”</p> <p>The corollary of athletes getting to grips with asthma is that asthmatic children are increasingly being encouraged to exercise. “We know that children with asthma are often excluded from sport, not by the school but by their parents,” said Deborah Waddell, lead clinical adviser for Asthma UK. “We advise people to take right type of exercise for them.”</p> <p>Dickinson says that more generally, sport can greatly help asthmatics: “It allows you to get a lot more confident about controlling the way you breathe. The sensation of an obstruction you feel when you’re younger has dropped massively. A lot of the athletes who say they had it as a child but don’t anymore, when you do the test they still have a positive test.”</p> <p>Karl Cooke, head of sports science medicine for British Swimming, says swimming is seen as particularly good: “Swimming can be really good as people have to learn a certain amount of breathing control. You need a certain rhythm that isn’t necessarily required in non-aquatic sports. So we have to be careful we also don’t scare people into thinking they’ll develop asthma because of swimming.”</p> <h2>Shock diagnosis</h2> <p>Aimee Willmott, British swimming champion in the 400m individual medley, was first tested for exercise-induced asthma after she went on a high-altitude training camp and found herself struggling for breath more than her team mates.</p> <p>The test results were something of a shock: “It turned out I was well into being an asthmatic, but I’d just never been diagnosed. With the asthma I was losing 20% of my lung function. It was a shock, but also a relief – I knew what the reason was for getting so out of breath.” Willmott was placed on two different asthma inhalers, a regime now boosted to include an inhaled steroid. The treatment has notably helped her training, she after another recent bout of wheezing explains: “I’ve gone from not knowing why I was struggling for breath to finally getting the right treatment. It’s helped me a lot. I was waking up in the morning out of breath, and struggling for breath in the pool.

Race introduced to capitalise on the Tour de France<br />• Event will reach parts of Yorkshire that missed out on the Tour<br /><a

the Tour de France snaked up Holme Moss and the Col de Buttertubs on its two stages through Yorkshire earlier this year, Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas said the atmosphere “was like being in a disco for four hours”. For the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire next year I Do Like To be Beside the Seaside might be a more apt soundtrack, with organisers revealing on Monday that Bridlington, Scarborough and the county’s coastal roads will all feature in the three-day event.</p> <p>Leeds, York, Selby and Wakefield will all also host either a stage start or finish in the race that has been introduced to capitalise on the huge success of the Tour de France in the region. More than three million people took to the streets and lanes of Yorkshire to witness the passing of the peloton and the economic benefit to the region has been estimated at £102m.</p> <p>Though the full route will not be published until 21 January, exactly 100 days before the start of the race on 1 May, the plan is clearly to send the race through areas which missed out on the spectacular events of the summer.</p> <p>“We wanted to make sure we took the race to parts of Yorkshire that missed out on the Tour de France and I am pleased to say that this first edition will heavily feature the Yorkshire coast,” said Gary Verity, chief executive of co-organisers Welcome to Yorkshire. “This was important for us because both ourselves and Christian Prudhomme [the Tour de France director at Amaury Sports Organisation] were disappointed we could not include the coast on the Grand Départ. We are delighted that issue can now be addressed.”</p> <p>Organisers have set their sights on the race becoming “a flagship cycling event in the UK in 2015 and an outstanding cycle race in the international calendar” and as such Verity is confident that those towns and cities to miss out in the 2015 edition will have the chance to host the race in the future.</p> <p>“The reality is we’re never going to satisfy everyone with every edition. There are 10,000km of roads in Yorkshire and our race will do less than 600km every year,” he said. “Simple maths says not everybody will be happy all the time but over a period of time I’m sure we will get a slice of the action to everyone that wants to take part.</p> <p>“In five years’ time I think everyone who wants to be covered will have been. We were oversubscribed this year and we have already had great representations for 2016 and beyond.”</p> <p>The 2015 race could potentially act as a warm-up for riders readying themselves to compete in the Giro d’Italia which starts the following weekend, although the dates of the Yorkshire event do overlap with the Tour de Romandie, an established six-stage World Tour race which was won by Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and Chris Froome in 2013 and 2014.</p>","headline":"Tour de Yorkshire’s inaugural race to feature county’s coastal roads","trailText":"The inaugural Tour of Yorkshire has been introduced to capitalise on the success of last year’s Tour de France Grand Départ","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419262051680/Tour-de-Yorkshire-Tour-de-006.jpg","wordcount":"492","commentable":"true","byline":"John Ashdown","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-25T15:51:18Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/22/tour-de-yorkshire-inaugural-race-coastal-roads","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/22/tour-de-yorkshire-inaugural-race-coastal-roads","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/johnashdown","webTitle":"John Ashdown","rcsId":"GNL000910","r2ContributorId":"15842","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/6/30/1341013877944/John-Ashdown-003.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"ashdown","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>John Ashdown is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport\">sport</a> journalist for the Guardian, with a keen interest in all things Football League-related</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnashdown","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/johnashdown","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"0bc25787461ff48a83cd46d0412c9fb9191092e0","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419262058939/Tour-de-Yorkshire-Tour-de-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419262058939/Tour-de-Yorkshire-Tour-de-011.jpg","source":"Rex Features","photographer":"Simon Wilkinson","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Tour de Yorkshire, Tour de France","suppliersReference":"3890982bi","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Simon Wilkinson/Rex Features","caption":"The inaugural Tour de Yorkshire will take in the county's coastal roads for the three-day event.

the Tour de France’s Yorkshire weekend to Roy Keane’s soul-searching and the Ryder Cup relived, our writers pick their best reads of 2014","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<h2>VIC MARKS</h2> <p>Chris Waters of the <em>Yorkshire Post</em> has a burgeoning reputation as an author. Following his much-lauded biography of Fred Trueman he has produced <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/10-for-10.html\" title=\"\"><strong>10 for 10</strong></a> (Wisden), the story of Hedley Verity and his great bowling feat at Headingley against Nottinghamshire in 1932. Verity may not have been as colourful a character as Trueman – and therefore not so easy to write about – but his achievements for Yorkshire are as phenomenal as Fred’s. Verity died at the age of 38 in the second world war. In Christopher Sandford’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/final-over-the-cricketers-of-summer-1914.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The Final Over: The Cricketers of Summer 1914</strong></a> (The History Press) the cricketers who gave their lives in the first world war are remembered, including another prolific left-arm spinner, the violin-playing Colin Blythe of Kent. The “Golden Age” of English cricket could not have come to a more abrupt and tragic end. The assumption is that everyone has had enough of the Kevin Pietersen saga for the moment. If not there are probably still a few copies of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/autobiography-25.html\" title=\"\"><strong>KP: The Autobiography</strong></a> (Sphere) left plus Simon Wilde’s sympathetic portrait <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/on-pietersen.html\" title=\"\"><strong>On Pietersen</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Simon &amp; Schuster).</p> <h2>EDDIE BUTLER</h2> <p>The trouble with undertaking a series of extreme challenges is that there is a limit to how many manifestations of exhaustion and numbness a reader can take without feeling a little exhausted and numb. You can repeat the line about this being absolutely the most knackering climb ever (since the last one a chapter back) until you are literally blue in the face, but it sorts of invites the question: so why do it? Fortunately, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/beyond-the-horizon.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Beyond the Horizon: Extreme Adventures at the Edge of the World</strong></a> (Sphere) is about Richard Parks, who seems to spend a lot of time asking himself the very same question. And the former rugby player is much more interesting in his inner space than on the vast tracts of icy menace. Not that the ferocity of Denali, the growing likelihood that he will lose at least a toe to frostbite, or the threat of terrorist attacks on Mount Elbrus don’t generate a certain dramatic tension in their own right. But the inner struggle to find something to do after a career in professional sport cut short – but not by much for a flanker in his 30s – is more interesting. The answer, if there is one, has something to do with deliberately surrendering to a potentially lethal addiction. My <em>Observer </em>colleague Michael Aylwin has done a fine job entering the mind of a psycho, and an even better one of getting the world’s most restless adventurer to sit down for five minutes to tell him all about it.</p> <h2>WILLIAM FOTHERINGHAM</h2> <p>These are boom times for cycling and a constant flow of ever more diverse reading matter is just one happy spin-off. For a truly luscious souvenir of this year, I’d go for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Days-Yorkshire-Official-Commemorative/dp/B00MEE187Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419089441&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=two+days+in+yorkshire\" title=\"\"><strong>Two Days in Yorkshire</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Pan y Agua Velo), a photographic account of the Tour de France’s Grand Départ compiled by Simon Wilkinson; for controversy, Nicole Cooke’s autobiography <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/breakaway-2.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The Breakaway</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Simon &amp; Schuster); for imagination Richard Moore’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/etape-2.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Etape</strong></a><strong> </strong>(HarperSport), which revisits the men behind some of the most dramatic, evocative and controversial stages in Tour de France history. Elsewhere, the former soigneur Emma O’Reilly’s memoir <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Race-Truth-Armstrong-cyclings/dp/0593074068\" title=\"\"><strong>The Race to Truth</strong></a> (Bantam Press) offered fresh insights into the Lance Armstrong story from a player who was neither campaigner nor cyclist but someone stuck in the middle; <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/cycling-anthology-volume-five.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The Cycling Anthology</strong></a> (Yellow Jersey), now in its fifth edition, remains unique in its mission to give writers a platform, and Ellis Bacon’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/great-british-cycling.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Great British Cycling </strong></a>(Bantam Press) traces the mixed fortunes of the sport on these shores and happily revisits forgotten greats such as Beryl Burton.</p> <h2>JACOB STEINBERG</h2> <p>Away from the headline-grabbing stories about his departure from Manchester United and his views on Sir Alex Ferguson, what made Roy Keane’s second autobiography, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/second-half.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The Second Half </strong></a>(W&amp;N), engaging was his willingness to examine his flaws. Ghostwritten by Roddy Doyle, Keane does not hold back as he explores the successes and failures of his managerial career and what makes him so prone to self-sabotage. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/pep-confidential.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Pep Confidential </strong></a>(Arena Sport) also offers a fine insight into the strains of management. Martí Perarnau was given unrivalled access to follow Pep Guardiola during his first season at Bayern Munich and discover what makes one of the best managers in the world tick. One for students of the game.</p> <p>Rob Smyth’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/danish-dynamite.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Danish Dynamite: The Story of Football’s Greatest Cult Team</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Bloomsbury), written with Mike Gibbons and Lars Eriksen, is about the Denmark team of the 1980s and it is well worth a read. A niche subject but few writers can bring a story to life as skilfully as Smyth.</p> <h2>KEVIN MITCHELL</h2> <p><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/scream-the-tyson-tapes.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Scream: The Tyson Tapes</strong></a>, by Jonathan Rendall (Short Books). In this short book, recovered and nurtured after his death by my erstwhile colleague Richard Williams, Jonny Rendall combines his love of fiction with the actuality of recorded interviews, a potential calamitous assignment in the hands of someone who sometimes regarded facts (not to mention deadlines) as impediments to a good story. Here he puts himself inside the head of Mike Tyson, which is a scary place to be, and weaves a gripping narrative through the contemporary observations and recollections of others. Sometimes the accounts of events conflict – notably those of his early mentors Teddy Atlas and Kevin Rooney – but those seeming anomalies only serve to encourage the view that Jonny finally stared truth in the face and embraced it, rather than bend it to his needs. Jonny, a friend, wrote a couple of terrific books, about boxing and gambling; this posthumous addition elegantly rounds out his contribution to sportswriting.</p> <h2>EWAN MURRAY</h2> <p>Iain Carter is best known in golfing circles as the authoritative voice behind Five Live’s coverage of the sport. Carter proved he has a further and impressive string to his bow with the writing of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/showdown-the-inside-story-of-the-gleneagles-ryder-cup.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Showdown</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Elliott &amp; Thompson), a forensic examination of the Ryder Cup meeting of Europe and the United States at Gleneagles. A book about the event would have been undeniably dull, given the comfortable nature of Europe’s latest win. Instead, Carter wonderfully and accurately chronicles the entire Ryder Cup story from captaincy selection to the sinking of the final putt in Perthshire. He encapsulates everything the contest involves, mainly by interviewing every key protagonist. This offers an attention to detail that replicates that of the successful European captain, Paul McGinley. In golfing biography terms, Ian Poulter’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/never-say-never-3.html\" title=\"\"><strong>No Limits</strong></a> (Quercus) has proved the pick of 2014. Poulter displays the forthright approach that makes him such an appealing character. His story, about as close as you will find to rags to riches in this era, should provide inspiration.</p> <h2>CHRIS COOK</h2> <p>It is too early to start talking about Tony McCoy, the perennial champion jump jockey, in the past tense; he continues to ride at the age of 40, despite the contusions, abrasions, lacerations and hospitalisations of the past two decades. So there is possibly something a shade premature about <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/mccoy.html\" title=\"\"><strong>McCoy: In the Frame</strong></a> (Racing Post), a collection of photographs from his record-breaking career. But this is a splendid book that ought to be treasured by any fan of jump racing. One of the great sporting careers deserves to be recorded by a comparable talent and McCoy has been well rewarded for giving such excellent access over the years to Edward Whitaker, the <em>Racing Post</em>’s longstanding snapper, recently named racing’s Photographer of the Year for an unprecedented sixth time. “It’s rather a shame that the best pictures of McCoy are when he’s either battered or covered in mud,” Whitaker told me. But then we all know what a winning jockey looks like. Whitaker’s shot of a young McCoy examining some nasty facial damage in his bathroom mirror is especially haunting. Anyone who ever backed one of his 4,000 winners should take time to contemplate this collection of moments triumphant and painful.</p> <h2>OWEN GIBSON</h2> <p>The initial furious reaction from some West Ham followers to the pre-publicity suggested Matt Dickinson’s <strong>Bobby Moore: The Man in Full</strong>, with its forensic approach, was about to make him about as popular as the hunter who raised his shotgun sights to Bambi. But the book in full more than justifies the subtitle, expertly and sensitively peeling back the layers of one of our best ever footballers to illuminate the man beneath.</p> <p>That is quite an achievement given that some of those who spent the most time with him admit they hardly knew him at all. In some ways the first footballer of the celebrity age and in others a product of his 1950s upbringing, Moore emerges as a man whose assurance on and off the pitch hid considerable turmoil beneath.</p> <p>By the end, it has also become a rumination on the nature of the modern sporting celebrity and our craving to put them on pedestal. Highly recommended.</p> <h2>BEST OF THE REST</h2> <p>In a better than average year for sport books David Goldblatt’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Our-Lives-Meaning-Football/dp/0670920584/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418061943&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+game+of+our+lives\" title=\"\"><strong>The Game Of Our Lives</strong></a> stood out for his analysis of the state of modern English football and how it got there, his conclusions insightful and troubling. Anna Krien’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Night-Games-Power-Journey-Heart/dp/0224100025/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418062354&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=night+games\" title=\"\"><strong>Night Games</strong></a>, the winner of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year, is also troubling, but her account of sexual assault and male team culture is powerful and honest writing. She was courageous to take on such subject matter, as was Gareth Thomas whose coming-out memoir, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Proud-My-Autobiography-Gareth-Thomas/dp/0091958334/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418062185&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=proud\" title=\"\"><strong>Proud</strong></a>, was as readable and moving as it was superior to the usual biogs. Of which there were a surprising number of decent entries this year, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Andrea-Pirlo-think-therefore-play/dp/1909430161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419015318&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andrea+pirlo\" title=\"\"><strong>Andrea Pirlo</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Corridor-Certainty-Geoffrey-Boycott/dp/1471130029/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419015395&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=geoffrey+boycott\" title=\"\"><strong>Geoffrey Boycott</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Playing-My-Way-Autobiography/dp/1473605202/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419015418&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sachin+tendulkar\" title=\"\"><strong>Sachin Tendulkar</strong></a> all weighing in with very decent reads. Finally, for a visual treat, cricket fans will love the Andrew Strauss-compiled <a href=\"https://shop.lords.org/shop/lords-gifts/books/lords-the-home-of-cricket/lords-a-celebration-in-pictures\" title=\"\"><strong>Lord’s A Celebration in Pictures</strong></a> (although possibly not the £50 price), while there’s a unique take on F1 in <a href=\"http://www.visionsp.co.uk/viewitem.aspx?id=261\"

But he remains barred for life by the Italian Cycling Federation under a 2002 ruling. Ferrari was also banned for life by Usada in 2012.</p> <p>“I’m telling you as a citizen of Italy: these long cases don’t help anyone,” Di Rocco said this week. “We always ask magistrates to help us and remove bad apples from cycling. But in the end we lose too much time. A lot of the people involved have already served bans.”</p> <p>Calls to Roberti’s office went unanswered but nobody has been called to trial yet in the case. A similar judicial inquiry involving alleged doping within the Lampre team has also dragged on for years without any conclusions.</p> <p>“When there are only doubts and shadows I think cycling is tired of that,” Di Rocco said.</p> <p>The Gazzetta dello Sport reported this month that investigators photographed Ferrari meeting with members of the Astana team outside the team’s training camp hotel one night in November 2013.</p> <p>Astana is the team of Tour champion Vincenzo Nibali, but his name does not appear in the Padua dossier that Coni received, the Olympic committee said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/09/michele-ferrari-denies-astana-meeting\" title=\"\">Ferrari wrote on his website earlier this month</a> that he never went to the team hotel.</p> <p>“Up to a few years ago I coached some of the Astana athletes, including [the team’s current general manager Alexandre] Vinokourov,” Ferrari said. “It has never been a secret. We never hid anything. We attended training venues where there were many other athletes, all in broad daylight.”</p> <p>The International Cycling Union <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/16/uci-president-brian-cookson-warns-astana-future-is-still-in-the-balance\" title=\"\">decided last week that Astana will keep its World Tour licence</a> – although on probation – despite five senior and development squad riders being caught doping with EPO and steroids since August.</p> <p>“There was certainly some tension within the squad,” Nibali said while at Coni on Monday for an awards ceremony. “I’ve always remained calm. We were waiting for the licence and in the end it came and it’s all been resolved well.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nibali is drawing out his schedule for 2015, and the big question is whether he’ll ride in the Giro d’Italia.</p> <p>“For sure I’ll do the Tour. Whereas for the Giro I’m still waiting,” he said.</p> <p>Di Rocco suggested that Nibali should “definitely” focus only on the Tour, partly because the Giro features an unusually long 59km (37-mile) time trial.</p> <p>“That’s so long it doesn’t suit anybody, not even [Chris] Froome or [Alberto] Contador,” Di Rocco said.</p>","headline":"Italian cycling president: police must act to stop Michele Ferrari influence","trailText":"Law enforcement authorities need to prevent the banned physician Michele Ferrari from seeing riders, according to the president of the Italian Cycling Federation","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/18/1418912751088/Michele-Ferrari-006.jpg","wordcount":"614","commentable":"false","byline":"Associated Press","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-21T14:26:25Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/18/michele-ferrari-italy-police-must-act","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/18/michele-ferrari-italy-police-must-act","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"86135feb299551fabab3ccd8b77671f23d7fe3a2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/18/1418912757230/Michele-Ferrari-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/18/1418912757230/Michele-Ferrari-011.jpg","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Nico Casamassima","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Michele Ferrari","suppliersReference":"PAR2004100130057","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Nico Casamassima/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"It has been alleged that Lance Armstrong's former doctor Michele Ferrari, centre, met with members of the Astana team last year.

The UCI president cited the road time trial, the team sprint and the Madison as offering opportunities for men and women to compete together.</p> <p>The intriguing possibility has arisen in the wake of reforms proposed by Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee. One recommendation adopted at the recent IOC meeting in Monte Carlo was that the Olympics should raise female participation to 50% and encourage mixed gender team events.</p> <p>Cycling brought in gender parity from the London Olympics in medal numbers, although athlete numbers vary because the road races currently have different team sizes for the men’s and women’s events, something that Cookson has said can be looked at in future.</p> <p>Cookson said his immediate priority is to conserve cycling’s present programme but added that he wants organisers to keep an open mind about events that may help cycling become more gender-equal. “In terms of mixed events, there is no history of that in the sport, but we need to look at it and see if it’s possible – perhaps it can be a way of bringing back some track events. If that is something the IOC feels would make cycling look attractive we need to look into that.</p> <p>“You could have a relay road time trial, where a woman does one lap of the course and a man does one, or you could have a mixed team sprint with two men and two women, or a mixed gender Madison,” said Cookson, adding that a mixed Madison – already a complex event to judge and referee – might present further difficulties such as deciding how long each team member could spend racing while the other rests.</p> <p>Cookson repeated his call for organisers to consider test events in mixed disciplines and said: “We need to look at all possibilities for making the sport more attractive. Let’s not close our minds, let’s be open.”</p> <p>Currently, the only cycling event that is mixed is the team relay at the UCI mountain biking championship, where teams of four have to consist of three men – elite, under-23 and junior – and one woman. The current world champions are France.</p> <p>Cycling currently has 18 events on the Olympic programme spanning four disciplines: road, track, mountain bike and BMX. The most recently introduced events on the track for women are the team pursuit and omnium, both of which have been well received.</p> <p>The Olympic and world pursuit champion Jo Rowsell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/04/jo-rowsell-london-track-cycling-world-cup-great-britain\" title=\"\">told the Guardian recently</a> that she felt the inception of the team pursuit had raised the standard of women’s endurance racing across the board. The keirin and team sprint are also relatively recent additions and have also proved successful.</p> <p>Cookson said that the cycling programme for Rio will not change, and that the venues for track, BMX and mountain biking are all under construction but should be complete in time for test events. The process of consulting with national federations over the 2020 programme will begin soon, he added.</p> <p>“We don’t want to lose medals or athlete places, but we are in a strong position thanks to the success of the cycling events at London 2012. A few years ago there was talk of cycling being thrown out but we are building from a position of strength.”</p> <p>He conceded that track cycling involves an expensive purpose-built venue but countered that with the argument that other cycling events such as the road race and time trials are relatively cheap to stage.</p> <p>“We can tell a good story about legacy and participation as well as showing images of popular events,” he said. “The legacy of London is that if you build a facility in the host city and manage it properly, people will want to use it.”</p>","headline":"Olympics could include mixed cycling events, says UCI’s Brian Cookson","trailText":"Mixed team events on road or track could be introduced to future Olympic programmes, the UCI president Brian Cookson has told the Guardian","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/12/17/1418829444033/Joanna-Rowsell-006.jpg","wordcount":"650","commentable":"true","byline":"William Fotheringham","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-20T22:00:09Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/17/olympics-mixed-cycling-uci-brian-cookson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/17/olympics-mixed-cycling-uci-brian-cookson","tags":[{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/uci","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/uci","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympics-general","webTitle":"Olympics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-general","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-general","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"fotheringham","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"d56e215c30e74d4b2860f354bec8c60eb75015e2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/12/17/1418829449777/Joanna-Rowsell-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Jon Super (commissioned)","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/12/17/1418829449777/Joanna-Rowsell-011.jpg","source":"Jon Super","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Joanna Rowsell","suppliersReference":"GD*44428343","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Jon Super","caption":"The Olympic champion Jo Rowsell feels the team pursuit had raised standards among women riders.

And the glow hasn’t faded yet, with participation still riding high and more major races planned<br><br>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/02/tour-de-france-2014-bluffer-guide\" title=\"\">July 2014: A bluffer’s guide to the Tour de France</a>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>For the 4.8 million people who lined England’s streets for the first three stages of the Tour de France this summer, the race itself was a fleeting affair. But while the peloton whizzed by in seconds, the memory lives on of what the Gallic organisers called the “grandest” Grand Départ in the 111-year history of the event.</p> <p>The roads of Yorkshire are still marked with graffiti urging on the Brit favourite, Mark “Cav” Cavendish – a poignant reminder that the Manx sprinter didn’t even make it to stage two after crashing at the first finish in Harrogate.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankviewcafe\">Bank View Cafe</a> at Langsett, on the edge of the Peak District, is still covered with the same red polka dots that adorn the King of the Mountains jersey, which is awarded to the best climber; sad to report, though, the <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/news/photos-yorkshire-sheep-in-tour-de-france-makeover.htm\">sheep in Killinghall that were sprayed yellow and green</a> to match the other jerseys are now back to their normal hues.</p> <p>Stage three of this year’s Tour went from Cambridge to London, but Yorkshire, which hosted the first two legs, was the real winner.</p> <p>A recent report estimated that the race <a href=\"http://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/Pages/Tour-de-France.aspx\">generated £128m for God’s Own County</a>, compared with just £30m for Cambridgeshire, Essex and London. The sourpusses down south failed to embrace the Tour with the same enthusiasm as their northern counterparts – just 78% of those surveyed around stage three said the race had been good for their local area, compared with 94% of those on stage two, which wound from York to Sheffield via the West Yorkshire Brontë Country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e110486e-7394-4e98-b177-4e03250a97d1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418838750782/623d115e-03aa-4840-a894-58181b5e1664-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sheep sprayed in the colours of the Tour de France winners' jerseys in Yorkshire in July 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheep sprayed in the colours of the Tour de France winners’ jerseys in Yorkshire in July 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Giles/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Harrogate, an initiative to create bunting out of knitted yellow jerseys proved so popular that organisers had to beg locals to put down their needles after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/mar/25/22000-jerseys-later-harrogate-gears-up-for-the-tour-de-france\">22,000 miniature jumpers had been sent in three months before the race even started</a>. In Otley, all 19 pubs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/jun/24/otley-pubs-translate-their-names-into-french-tour-de-france-yorkshire-2014\">translated their names into French to welcome the race</a>, while at Appleton’s butchers in the market town of Ripon, the elite riders were welcomed with <a href=\"http://mediaserver.dwpub.com/press-release/37875/Picture1.png\">a bicycle made from pies</a>. A team of 12 staff spent 24 hours perfecting their creation, using enormous pork pies for wheels, black pudding for handlebars, chipolatas for the chain and a gammon joint for the saddle.</p> <p>On the Yorkshire legs, particularly on the big climbs of Holme Moss and Butter Tubs Pass, spectators cheered with such gusto that one British rider, Geraint Thomas, later said: “It was like being in a disco for four hours.”</p> <p>British Cycling insists the three-day cycling jamboree has left a legacy of active cyclists across the nation. More than 95,000 people took part in British Cycling-registered events in the regions touched by the Tour de France in 2014 – a year in which total participation across all British Cycling’s recreational programmes increased by 64%.</p> <p>A new <a href=\"http://letour.yorkshire.com/tour-de-yorkshire\">international three-day stage race in Yorkshire</a> has also been announced for 2015, with the Tour de Yorkshire cementing the region as a host of major international bike racing.</p> <p>• The caption of the first picture was amended on 18 December 2014 because an earlier version said it was of the peloton making its way up Grinston Moor. This has been corrected to say Grinton Moor.<br /></p>","headline":"How Yorkshire won the 2014 Tour de France: the Grandest Départ’s legacy","trailText":"<strong>Helen Pidd</strong>: For Cambridge and London, but most of all for Yorkshire, the glow of hosting the start of the world’s greatest cycling race hasn’t faded yet","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418838602088/Tour-de-France-006.jpg","wordcount":"549","commentable":"true","byline":"Helen Pidd","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-20T19:18:35Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/17/how-yorkshire-won-the-2014-tour-de-france","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/17/how-yorkshire-won-the-2014-tour-de-france","tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"news/series/2014-what-happened-next","webTitle":"2014: what happened next?","description":"What became of the grieving families left in the aftermath of flight MH370?

Wiggins has said he will go for the record in June but speculation is mounting in cycling circles that it could be the Essex time trialist who becomes the first Briton since Chris Boardman in 2000 to attempt it.</p> <p>Dowsett’s Movistar team have called a press conference for Friday in London to make what they describe as “a special announcement” amid reports that they have booked the London velodrome for a series of private sessions costing £500 a time. Dowsett has been a regular performer at the Lee Valley Velopark this winter, riding the weekly track league there.</p> <p>The Revolution Meeting at the Lee Valley Velodrome on 27-28 February is already hosting an attempt on the women’s record by Britain’s most successful Paralympian, Sarah Storey, which was announced on Tuesday. Storey will make her bid to better Leontien van Moorsel’s 2003 distance on 28 February, which would leave the Revolution session on Friday 27 February open for Dowsett.</p> <p>“For sure it’s something I’d like to have a crack at,” said Dowsett recently when asked about the record. “It’s nice that it’s been brought out again and modernised.” The UCI revised the rules on equipment for the Hour this year, making it possible to use the same kit as for most timed events on the track; the upshot has been a resurgence in interest with Wiggins making no bones of his interest in putting the record on the shelf before he retires.</p> <p>The changes prompted successful bids this autumn by the German Jens Voigt, and the current holder Matthias Brandle of Austria, who set a distance of 51.852km in Switzerland on 30 October.</p> <p>The Australian rider Rohan Dennis also announced on Wednesday that he will try for the record on 8 February next year, in Grenchen, Switzerland. Other names said to be considering attempts include the Australian track specialist Jack Bobridge, a silver medallist in the London Olympics at the team pursuit, and the Dutch road professional Thomas Dekker.</p> <p>Dowsett is 26 and has a track pedigree going back to his days as a junior, when he was a European team pursuit champion. Since turning professional for Team Sky in 2011 he has made his name as a time-trial specialist, winning a stage in the 2013 Giro d’Italia, ahead of Wiggins, in his first year with the Spanish squad Movistar. He took the time-trial title at the Commonwealth Games in August, and has landed three British national time-trial championships, adding the national 10-mile record last May.</p>","headline":"Alex Dowsett plots to beat Bradley Wiggins to world hour record bid","trailText":"Alex Dowsett, the former British time-trial champion, could steal a march on Sir Bradley Wiggins by attempting the men’s world hour record in London in February","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/12/17/1418826648790/Alex-Dowsett-006.jpg","wordcount":"447","commentable":"false","byline":"William Fotheringham","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-20T14:39:36Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/17/alex-dowsett-bradley-wiggins-world-hour-record","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/17/alex-dowsett-bradley-wiggins-world-hour-record","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"fotheringham","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"53f567e795079818be3023f4ebd60aadf56e8389","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/12/17/1418826655585/Alex-Dowsett-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA Archive/Press Association Ima","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/12/17/1418826655585/Alex-Dowsett-011.jpg","source":"PA Archive/Press Association Ima","photographer":"Martin Rickett","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Alex Dowsett","suppliersReference":"Tour of Britain 3 MR2_8510.jpg","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA Archive/Press Association Ima","caption":"Alex Dowsett has described the world hour record as ‘something I’d like to have a crack at’.

They face possible trouble on several fronts.</p> <p>A team from Lausanne University have a deadline of February 2015 to audit the extent to which Astana were responsible for the doping cases, and assess their governance. They will also assess Astana’s compliance to a set of measures due to be introduced in 2017 intended to make teams more responsible for their individual riders. Cookson said any failure to cooperate with the audit team would be viewed as “a very big negative. They should be under no illusions that if they don’t fully cooperate that will be counted against them.”</p> <p>The UCI is also waiting for the Italian Olympic Committee (Coni) to send them a police report compiled by magistrates in Padua into illegal payments linked to doping, which, according to the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, has linked the banned trainer Dr Michele Ferrari to the team. Ferrari has denied the claim.</p> <p>Cookson said the UCI had contacted Coni daily since details of the report were leaked last week, but its understanding is that Coni is awaiting clearance from the magistrates to forward the report to the governing body. “Frankly it wouldn’t take very much for them to be referred back to the licence commission.” Cookson said. “Astana have a long and chequered history going back eight years, and that too could tell against them.” He then repeated that one more positive test could spell the end.</p> <p>The UCI president added that he had been very disappointed with the way Astana reacted to the verdict of the commission, which is independent of the UCI, putting out a press release saying they were “happy and proud” while a picture was published of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/11/astana-cycling-worldtour-licence-uci-doping\" title=\"\">the team celebrating with champagne</a>.</p> <p>“There was nothing to be celebrating about,” Cookson said. “Allegations continue to be made which are very worrying for them as a team and as individuals. We are all getting heartily sick of it.”</p> <p>The licence commission has two levels of sanctions it can take against a team: relegation from WorldTour to the Continental circuit, which is largely symbolic as the team can continue to compete, or withdrawal of their licence which effectively means they cease to exist.</p> <p>The Astana imbroglio goes to the heart of the problem which has dogged cycling since the Festina scandal of 1998. Doping became institutionalised within teams and within minds, and to date the governing body has struggled to penalise teams rather than individuals. Riders can be banned for failing drugs tests; it has proved harder to take steps against their teams.</p> <p>“Our rules and Wada rules and institutional rules have not been strong enough in the past,” said Cookson, who has been in post for only 15 months. The new Wada code will help in that area, as it brings in rules against associating with individuals or groups of people considered persona non grata. The Wada code will also enable sanctions to be taken against teams, but more in the context of individual events, for example a relay race, rather than teams as institutions or businesses.</p> <p>The latter case, said Cookson, “creates a whole new set of problems because then you are talking about legal action being taken in other than sporting courts if you are talking about closing down a business or a source of employment. Once you get into this you get into money-laundering, supply chains, you get into criminality quite quickly. You are outside purely sporting terms of reference.”</p> <p>Cookson added that without the work of governments in investigating doping, “we would be in a much worse position than we are now. That side of it has been very, very helpful, but when you are dealing with these complex cases you have to go through due process.</p> <p>“We can’t act on information in reports that are on the internet, we have to wait for factual evidence, and make sure it’s admissible in a court of law, because there is nothing more certain than that people will appeal to Cas [Court of arbitration for Sport] or elsewhere. We’ve got to be belt and braces certain before we take any action. The licence commission has made a very detailed assessment, making a judgment which allows further consideration of information if it comes to light and I’m confident that will be sooner rather than later.”</p>","headline":"UCI president Brian Cookson warns Astana future is still in the balance","trailText":"UCI president Brian Cookson warns that another drug scandal would spell the end for Astana","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418756311987/UCI-president-Brian-Cooks-006.jpg","wordcount":"835","commentable":"false","byline":"William Fotheringham","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-19T18:59:48Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/16/uci-president-brian-cookson-warns-astana-future-is-still-in-the-balance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/16/uci-president-brian-cookson-warns-astana-future-is-still-in-the-balance","tags":[{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/uci","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/uci","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"fotheringham","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"3d1540f7b889e52915577252e08783d34730cc09","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418756317260/UCI-president-Brian-Cooks-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418756317260/UCI-president-Brian-Cooks-011.jpg","source":"Reuters","photographer":"Giampiero Sposito","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"UCI president, Brian Cookson, says Astana could still easily lose the licence issued them last week.","suppliersReference":"GSP01","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Giampiero Sposito/Reuters","caption":"UCI president, Brian Cookson, says Astana could still easily lose the licence issued them last week.

Never can a nation have been more grateful.

Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>For Northern Ireland, still struggling to establish a post-Troubles identity 16 years after the Good Friday Agreement, a cycling race broadcast to 165 countries (and a potential audience of up to 800 million people) is a very big deal indeed – even if, with Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish giving the Giro a miss in favour of the Tour de France, only a tiny proportion of spectators will be able to name a single competitor.</p><p>\"This is the biggest event we have ever had in Northern Ireland,\" says Ross who, as private secretary to Arlene Foster, the province's trade and investment minister, was part of the initial delegation that travelled to Italy in 2012 to woo race organisers RCS Sport.</p><p>Last year's G8 conference, held in County Fermanagh, brought the world's news media to the province, \"but it wasn't something that local people got involved in,and it wasn't something everyone would necessarily be near. This race covers so much of Northern Ireland geographically and allows so many people to interact with it.\"</p><p>The Northern Ireland government paid £3m for the right to host the event, says Ross, and committed to a promotional campaign to support it. \"But already in terms of publicity we have had more than 10 times that in return.\"</p><p>But for all the enthusiasm, this is a part of the world where even the most carnivalesque parade has a capacity to turn political. There was early discontent when the race route was announced when it became apparent that while (mostly Protestant) east Belfast was well served, much of (mostly Catholic) west Belfast would be bypassed by the riders. \"What we will see is all other parts of the city being touched and being seen worldwide except west Belfast, and it is just not good enough,\" said local Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey.</p><p>Representatives from south Down, also a majority Catholic area, were similarly aggrieved that the race would bypass the Mourne mountain area.</p><p>Ross says the final decision on the route was taken by RCS Sport – it was their decision, for instance, to take the time trial up the steep mile-long driveway to the parliament buildings at Stormont –  but that \"from a tourism point of view we just wanted to make sure our main tourist locations were shown off\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-436122411'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399310539957/Giro-dItalia-009.jpg' alt='Giro d'Italia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A tractor and bicycle have been painted pink on the Giro d'Italia 2014 route via the Causeway Coastal Route. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>More serious was a bitter dispute over paramilitary murals, several of which will be passed by the riders along the route. Politicians from all parties struck a deal in February to remove campaign posters for the local and European elections from the route, in order to show the province \"in the best possible light\". But when Anna Lo, an assembly member for the cross-community Alliance party, suggested murals showing masked gunmen could also be painted over, she was met with a furious response that included, from some quarters, vicious racist abuse (Lo was born in Hong Kong and is a longstanding campaigner for ethnic minorities in the province).</p><p>East Belfast has an Alliance MP, Naomi Long, but after the party voted with nationalists to stop the union jack being flown every day from Belfast's city hall, sparking protests in December 2012, it is wildly unpopular in the area's loyalist estates. Last Tuesday evening, the party's Newtownards Road constituency office, past which the riders will cycle on Friday, was firebombed. The large pink cycle in the office window on the morning following the attacks was accompanied by panelling over the broken windows and scorch marks.</p><p>\"The abuse I have got [since the flags protest] is taking a toll,\" says Lo. \"I have a lot of really foul abuse, really degrading abuse online. I have been having threats made against me, picked up by the police. There was also a spent bullet and a photograph of me sent to a Sunday paper. My stand is still the same, that I am not going to be silenced by the bullies, but it is relentless.\"</p><p>She doesn't regret her comments on the murals on the race route, however. \"Not at all, no. I stand by it. It's a great occasion for Northern Ireland to showcase what a beautiful place it is and that we have moved past the days of the Troubles. But there is still a small element of people here who are stuck in the past and only really concerned about sectarian politics.  Many local people themselves don't like the murals, she says, but fear intimidation if they speak out.</p><p>\"The first time we heard anything about the Giro was when Anna Lo popped up to say 'We don't want these images of paramilitarism being displayed around the world',\" says David Stitt. The former loyalist prisoner who now runs Charter NI, a community organisation promoting education and peacebuilding among working class Protestant communities He condemns the firebombing and abuse directed at Lo, but passionately disagrees with her. \"Those murals have been there for 25 years. To us, that's part of our culture. The conflict is part of our history here and you just can't airbrush it away.\"</p><p>As he notes, the murals are themselves a major tourist attraction, even if locals benefit little from the tour buses that frequently pause outside his office window, which is also on the race route.</p><p>\"The Giro d'Italia coming through here, it's a good start. But it'll showcase in this area the fact that there's no infrastructure here,\" says Stitt, who claims the tourist and business development at the Titanic quarter, in the east Belfast docklands that were once this area's major employers, have seen millions spent in their area from which local people are effectively locked out. More work needs to be done, he says, to ensure the dividends of the peace process reach the communities that were worst affected by the Troubles.</p><p>And yet, despite inevitable bumps in the road, the race's arrival in the province represents progress that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago, according to Ross. After passing the heart of loyalist east Belfast, where the Presbyterian church has hoisted a bright pink cycle at its front window, the riders will race to the Catholic Lower Ormeau Road, passing the memorial to five people shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries in 1992.

The laws of France cease to operate. The gendarmes are there not to enforce the laws of the state but the laws of the tour. Goddet can perform marriages like a sea captain. No one, not even de Gaulle, would dare raise his voice in anger if Goddet shot down a Russian or American who had violated his air space.\" He said it in jest before a leg of the Tour and after following it for a day, I believe him.</p><p>Jacques Goddet, executive director of <em>L'Equipe</em>, stood in his long British colonial shorts with a toupee on his Alec Guinness head, administrating the start of the night stage of the Tour with the calm of a district commissioner receiving a tribal delegation. Journalists gazed at him through mouthfuls of seafood and Muscadet, admiring the man who had conceived and modernised the Tour, which an American journalist once described as the best piece of organisation since the North African landings.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411915571'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372341315690/jacques-goddet-001.jpg' alt='jacques goddet' width='200' height='198' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France and founder of the daily newspaper L'Equipe. Photograph: Gamma-Keystone</figcaption></figure><p>At the off that strange whirring noise of 130 cyclists began to eat up the road to Bordeaux. Behind them, team cars covered with advertisements and spare bikes with their wheels spinning against a background of yacht masts in La Rochelle harbour and to the left of them a stampeding horde of journalists and photographers. Goddet's co-director leads the riders while he sits just behind, calling up the team cars to change a puncture – done at Le Mans speed – or hauling a red flag up his aerial to stop following cars from passing the cyclists when the road is too dangerous or narrow. It was always dangerous and mostly narrow. If there was no room to pass on the road, the cars mounted the pavements and gave the spectators a thrill by sandwiching them on the kerb.</p><p>Italian car horns blared through the peaceful French countryside and one was glad that the Protestant facade of La Rochelle had been rid of the all-conquering Latin vulgarity of the Tour.</p><p>The road runs arrow-like over the undulating East Anglia-esque flat lands by the Atlantic, before it turns inland through the Romanesque vineyards of the Gironde and on down to Bordeaux.</p><p>All of France seemed to be picnicking. Peasants hacked at bread and cheese or brought out antiquated telescopes, soldiers had the day off and while provincial bourgeoisie sat at their respectable tables, forks in their hands and transistors in their ears. For a journalist perhaps the greatest elation of all is the feeling known best to heads of state of riding a convertible, standing up on the seat at full speed through the villages and acknowledging the cheering of women and children. General MacArthur on his recall from Korea.</p><p>If you looked behind at the straining hordes and incredible pace of the cyclists, you were soon deflated by their superlative physical condition; the brown, wind-polished limbs and the teamwork of getting a competitor back in the crowd as three of four team-mates slip-streamed the stricken rider from in front and the team car virtually pushed him from behind. The stage to Bordeaux is normally boring except that it is the last before the mountains and often won by a Dutchman. The Pyrenees, which lie ahead, will sort out the real competitors before they reach Barcelona on Saturday evening.</p><p>Nobody quite knows why the Dutch win at Bordeaux, perhaps the final effort of the \"platlanders\" before the Pyrenees or the celebration of arrival on familiar terrain after the Pyrenees – whichever way the Tour is run.</p><p>Of three Italians, young Felipe Gimondi is in the lead, with Adorni and Motta well placed. Some feel that Poulidor, the French favourite, who is now in second, has already won. Poulidor himself said: \"The mountains are our chance and we're going to seize it,\" he said. The Spaniards think otherwise. \"The Pyrenees,\" said the great climber Bahamontes, \"will be an entirely Spanish recital.\"</p><p><em>This is an edited extract</em></p>","headline":"From the Observer archive, 4 July 1965: The man who makes the Tour de France's wheels turn","trailText":"<p><strong>Andrew Mulligan</strong> watches Jacques Goddet preside over the annual national jamboree that is the Tour de France</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372335911794/Sunbathing-Tour-de-France-005.jpg","wordcount":"684","commentable":"true","byline":"Andrew Mulligan","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-27T11:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/france","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/agenda","webTitle":"Agenda","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","webTitle":"From the Observer archive","description":"Historic articles from the Observer archive.

Obree, described as a genius by Sir Chris Hoy, possessed huge natural talent and drive, but a series of factors – not least his refusal to touch the drugs then prevalent in the sport – cut short his career in the 1990s and he slipped into relative obscurity and intermittent depression.</p><p>Now at 47, he plans to try for the world human-powered land speed record on a machine which he rides head first, just above the ground. If that wasn't enough, the bike was almost entirely built in his kitchen from recycled parts, including metal from an old saucepan.</p><p>The idea that a self-built steel-framed creation, which Obree estimates cost around £1,000 to build, could tackle the 82.8 mph record set in 2009 by a Canadian rider using a computer-modelled, carbon fibre-shelled recumbent machine, seems ludicrous. But this is well-trodden ground for Obree, one of the more creative, bloody-minded and enigmatic characters in British sport.</p><p>The Ayrshire-based rider achieved fame from seemingly nowhere in July 1993 when he broke the world one-hour cycle distance record at a Norwegian velodrome, using a self-built bike, Old Faithful. This incorporated a self-created, highly aerodynamic tuck position as well as, famously, ballbearings borrowed from a washing machine.</p><p>Obree retook his record the following year, also winning a track world championship title on Old Faithful. When cycling's governing body, the UCI, outlawed the tuck stance, Obree came back with an equally creative alternative, the stretched out \"Superman\" position, to win another world title.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531352'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372165923377/Graeme-Obree-1996-Olympic-010.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree 1996 Olympics' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree competes during the preliminary round of the men's individual pursuit at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That was where it ended. It is arguably paradoxical to describe a man whose autobiography, The Flying Scotsman, was made into a film staring Jonny Lee Miller, as an unsung hero, but Obree never notched up the titles and fame of his peers, such as Chris Boardman.</p><p>Obree's sole Olympics, in 1996, saw him exit in the preliminary rounds. His career with a French professional road cycling team lasted one day. Obree has always maintained he was sacked when he made it clear he would not use drugs.</p><p>He has endured a turbulent personal life, affected by self-criticism and depression, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Obree came out as gay a couple of years ago, something he says has contributed to his happiness. His decision to do so is still relatively unusual in professional sport.</p><p>He reinvented himself as an author and a speaker, and just over two years ago began plotting an attempt at the human-powered bike speed record. Rather than adapt one of the feet-first recumbent bikes traditionally used for such bids, Obree, typically, started from scratch.</p><p>The result is the Beastie, in which the rider lies face down and head forward, with his or her feet powering a pair of narrower push-pull levers rather than conventional pedals.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531353'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372166249301/Graeme-Obree-001.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree' width='220' height='424' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree on the sea front in Ayrshire in 2007. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>\"The idea came from first principles,\" Obree said. \"The widest part of the body is the shoulders, so if you think about a teardrop shape it makes sense to have that at the front, and the feet‚ with the push-pull, meaning they just miss each other at the narrowest part, at the back.</p><p>\"The first thing I had to do was the basic outline of the structure. The body's the one thing you can't change. Everything else was built around that mechanically.\"</p><p>The Beastie was built mainly in Obree's small flat in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, with excursions to a friend's workshop. The steel frame came primarily from old bikes, and as many other components as possible were recycled. Stainless steel from an old saucepan became part of a shoulder rest.</p><p>Such a process was necessary, given the innovative design. Obree said: \"It was one of those things where I didn't know exactly what I wanted until I could see how it came into shape. If you're building it yourself you can make all the fine changes as you go along. If it's done by someone else, when it comes back you'll go: 'Oh, that's wrong,' and it could take weeks to fix. But doing it myself, in my own flat, the same process could take an hour.\"</p><p>Obree has tried out the machine once, wobbling to a modest 30mph or so on a runway at Prestwick airport, without the aerodynamic fairing, as he got used to the low-slung machine's twitchy ride. \"The main thing was, once I was launched I could hold a relatively straight line,\" he said. \"That's good to know. I'd say the test was pretty successful in terms of mechanical parts working. The skin's fine, the bike's steerable, nothing fell off.\"</p><p>In September Obree and the Beastie will decamp to a super-smooth, high altitude road in Nevada for the annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge. He is promising nothing. \"All I can do is go and give it a good punt,\" he said. However, a record would bring renewed recognition.</p><p>The temptation is to create a narrative in which this would be vindication for a man denied the celebrity of Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins thanks to petty officialdom and the endemic drug taking of early 1990s cycling. <a href=\"http://road.cc/content/news/36717-graeme-obree-interview-part-2-doping-olympics-uci-regulations-and-future-projects\" title=\"\">Obree, typically, doesn't see it that way</a>.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways I wouldn't like to be as famous as Bradley Wiggins. I think that would be totally awful, actually, getting stopped in the street everywhere. I get it occasionally but it's quite polite, it's nice. It's not a crowd of people around you, like Chris Hoy gets. I wouldn't want that level of fame.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, Obree says he is glad the post-Lance Armstrong cycling era is more ready to hear his story: \"I've got no regret about not taking drugs. But I obviously wonder how I'd have got on at the Tour de France. That was what I was lined up for. But that wasn't my overriding goal from the start, my goal was a world record, so I got that, and the world championships. The Olympics got away, obviously. And it would have been great to get Olympic gold and, say, a Tour de France stage win. But hey ho.</p><p>\"And you know what? I escaped with my health and my honour. In a lot of ways I don't have any regrets.\"</p><p></p><h2>An innovative man</h2><p>To get a sense of the extent to which Graeme Obree likes to re-think the very fundamentals of his sport, consider his self-penned 2012 training manual, The Obree Method. Inside is an entire chapter about how to adapt your breathing so as to absorb more oxygen (it's all to do with the out-breaths).</p><p>Craig MacLean, who competed on the velodrome for Britain at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, recalls first meeting Obree at track competitions in the early 1990s.</p><p>\"He thinks about everything in a very unconventional way. There's some ideas about training he gave me which I still use today. Cycling is almost like a big experiment for him.</p><p>\"He was a bit of a maverick around that era. Cycling was very much a traditional sport ‚you only ever rode fixed gear in the winter and you had to do a certain number of miles before you were allowed back on your normal road bike, all these things that had been around since the dark ages. But he always did things differently.\"</p>","headline":"Flying Scotsman Graeme Obree returns with beastly bid at another world record","trailText":"Cycling's unsung hero to take on human powered speed contest on the Beastie, which he built from recycled parts in his kitchen","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3gp28","wordcount":"1223","commentable":"true","byline":"Peter Walker","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-06-28T14:13:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/25/flying-scotsman-graeme-obree-cycling-beastie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/25/flying-scotsman-graeme-obree-cycling-beastie","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/world-records","webTitle":"World records","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-records","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/world-records","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"environment/bike-blog","webTitle":"Bike blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on all things cycling - in the UK and around the world","type":"blog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"world/world-records","webTitle":"World records","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world-records","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world-records","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"walker","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

Apologizing for disappointing them and putting the foundation at risk, Armstrong reportedly \"choked up\" during the meeting, and several other employees were in tears, too.</p><p>Armstrong told staffers he would try to restore Livestrong's reputation, and encouraged them to continue supporting the charity's mission to help cancer patients and their families.</p><p>Armstrong, a cancer survivor, founded Livestrong in 1997.

That's all I can say.\"</p><p>Winfrey's network OWN said Armstrong agreed to a \"no-holds-barred\" interview. \"Amstrong will address the alleged doping scandal, years of accusations of cheating and charges of lying about the use of performance-enhancing drugs throughout his storied cycling career,\" the network said in a statement.</p><p>The interview is set to air Thursday at 9pm eastern time in the US on the Oprah Winfrey Network and will be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/09/lance-armstrong-interview-oprah-winfrey\">streamed live internationally on Oprah.com.</a></p><p>Armstrong has continued to maintain his innocence, but is facing several legal challenges, and has lost millions of dollars in sponsorship deals and endorsements.

But as for so many other tarnished public figures, the journey of disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong will next week end opposite Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>Winfrey has confirmed that Armstrong, who in October was stripped of all his titles and labelled a \"serial drug cheat\" by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), will seek redemption on her show.</p><p>In a 90-minute interview from his home in Austin, Texas, he will speak publicly for the first time about the doping revelations that led to a lifetime ban from sport. It will be streamed live around the world on Oprah.com next Thursday as well as broadcast in the US at 2am UK time.</p><p>It is the first time Armstrong has given an interview since he lost his titles, was dropped by sponsors and pilloried by the public for his part in a doping conspiracy that spanned more than a decade and was described in excoriating detail in a 202-page report by Usada.</p><p>Within hours, bookmakers were offering odds on which words Armstrong would use in the interview, with Ladbrokes quoting 1-4 on \"apologise\" and evens on \"confess\". They were offering 8-11 on Armstrong breaking down in tears.</p><p>Travis Tygart, the Usada chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/19/travis-tygart-us-anti-doping-lance-armstrong\" title=\"\">told the Guardian in an interview last month</a> that he hoped an Armstrong confession could yet act as a powerful symbol for drug-free sport.</p><p>But others, including another former cycling drug cheat who has since become a respected anti-doping campaigner, immediately voiced concerns that a stage-managed talkshow was not the right forum to discuss claims that as recently as October Armstrong's lawyer was dismissing as a \"one-sided hatchet job\".</p><p>\"Only Lance would get to have his moment of truth, if that's what it will be, in front of Oprah Winfrey,\" said British cyclist David Millar, who was banned for two years in 2004 for injecting EPO at a time when doping was rife in the professional peloton.</p><p>\"It is not sitting in front of a judge or a disciplinary hearing being properly questioned about the things he has done wrong. I doubt very much it will be a proper interrogation,\" added Millar, who is a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency's athletes commission. \"My biggest concern is that it will be completely stage-managed, that he will just be 'given the ball', and that it will all be about his emotions rather that concentrating on exactly what he did wrong.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Oprah show said Armstrong was not being paid to appear and that Winfrey was free to ask any question she wanted. \"No payment for the interview. No editorial control, no question is off limits,\" the spokeswoman said in an email.</p><p>The Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), which will show the programme, is a joint venture between Winfrey's Harpo Productions and Discovery Channel. Discovery was the headline sponsor of Armstrong's team between 2004 and 2007.</p><p>It was that network's logo that was emblazoned on his shirt when he won his seventh Tour in 2005 and claimed it as a victory over \"the people that don't believe in cycling, the cynics and the sceptics\". Discovery was a vocal supporter of Armstrong and one of the last sponsors to distance itself from the Texan once Usada's damning evidence was published.</p><p>Former colleagues and rivals immediately began speculating on whether Armstrong would use the programme as a platform for contrition or an attempt to shift the blame. Armstrong had previously told a US tribunal that he had never used performance-enhancing drugs, opening up the possibility that he could perjure himself if he now admitted doping.</p><p>The Texan is at the centre of several ongoing legal disputes, while the Sunday Times is suing him for the repayment of a libel settlement the newspaper was forced to pay him over doping allegations.</p><p>Many fear Winfrey will give Armstrong an easy ride, recalling her interview with Olympic gold medallist Marion Jones, in which the weeping American sprinter claimed she took performance-enhancing drugs unintentionally.</p><p>Kathy LeMond, wife of the US Tour de France winner Greg, tweeted: \"@Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview.
