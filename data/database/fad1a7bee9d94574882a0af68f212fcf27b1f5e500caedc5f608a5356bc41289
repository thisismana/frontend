I’m just resting my eyes.</strong> Say “Name”. We need to get started.</p> <p><strong>Name: </strong>Social jetlag.</p> <p><strong>I’m going back to bed now.</strong> No you’re not. You have to ask about its appearance.</p> <p><strong>Look, I was up until 3am drinking advocaat and playing board games. Can’t this wait? </strong>No.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Early January, for a lot of people. Almost constantly for an unlucky few.</p> <p><strong>What are we talking about here anyway? </strong>You know that feeling when you have to go back to work again after some time off?</p> <p><strong>I am familiar with it, yes. </strong>Well, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8231684/Workers-who-feel-jaded-after-Christmas-break-are-suffering-from-social-jet-lag-claim-scientists.html\">it’s called social jetlag</a>.</p> <p><strong>I thought it was just called “that feeling when you have to go back to work again”? </strong>Not sciencey enough, I’m afraid. This is a proper science thing.</p> <p><strong>Can you explain it to someone who is still mostly advocaat? </strong>I can try. Basically lots of your bodily processes – metabolism, sleep, alertness and so on – run according to a daily timetable controlled by the hours of sunlight. These are called your circadian rhythms.</p> <p><strong>I’m making myself an espresso. Would you like one? </strong>No thanks. Anyway, people’s rhythms vary quite a bit. Some are naturally late risers, some are naturally early, and most are somewhere in the middle. This is called your chronotype.</p> <p><strong>I think I’ll have a double espresso. </strong>Therefore, people with late chronotypes have to adapt their rhythms quite severely to suit their working hours. They manage this by using a lot of caffeine on work days, then have long lie-ins to recover. During a period off work, such as over Christmas, the lie-ins may even settle into a new routine.</p> <p><strong>So they revert to chronotype? </strong>Exactly. But then it takes a while to shift your rhythm back again, and during this period people become tired, irritable, clumsy, disorientated, ill and generally not much use. Hence: social jetlag.</p> <p><strong>I see. </strong>Some research even suggests that social jetlag is linked with smoking, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16687322\">drinking</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21895489\">depression</a>.</p> <p><strong>So what’s the cure? </strong>Basically, you need to find a way of making sure that you never get a lie-in, even during the holidays.</p> <p><strong>Having children? </strong>Yes, that should do it.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“I think I’ll just move to a time zone that suits my new body clock.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Welcome to Greenland!”</p>","headline":"Are you suffering from social jetlag?","trailText":"Feeling tired, irritable and not much use back at work?

The first of the waves that Nigel Farage and others promised, of benefit-claiming East Europeans who would engulf this green and pleasant land. Après him, the deluge! </strong>It was feared/politically useful to pretend they would be seeking to suckle at the bounteous teat of Britain’s social security system. Though it turned out that their immigration numbers actually fell after the rule change.</p> <p><strong>Whatevs. There was an advert in the Daily Telegraph about them all being criminals. </strong>Placed by Nigel Farage.</p> <p><strong>Yes, so I knew it was true. He has a face you can’t help but trust. The ad said that 7% of all crime in the EU was carried out by Romanian gangs. 7%! No wonder he said people were right to be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door – imagine having only an 93% chance of not being killed by them in the night! </strong>Would it help if I told you that it was all crap?</p> <p><strong>No. Tell me, how much has Spirescu managed to drain from us over the past year? </strong>He left his first job, carwashing in Biggleswade, after a day ...</p> <p><strong>Aha! To float luxuriously on a sea of universal credit and housing benefit, I presume? </strong>No, because media attention made it impossible for him to stay. He went to London to work on building sites instead and now makes about £80 a day.</p> <p><strong>Oh. Well, I bet he’s planning to milk the system at some stage. </strong>He’s planning to go home, actually.</p> <p><strong>Why? What’s wrong with here? Is his wallet too small for his 50s? Are all our diamond shoes too tight? </strong>“I miss my village, my life in Romania. It’s all right but I come here to make some money and then I’ll go back. I don’t want to live for ever here.”</p> <p><strong>Unbelievable! He comes over here, takes a job that someone else could have had </strong>... but for some reason wasn’t taking ...</p> <p><strong>And then doesn’t even have the courtesy to stay! He’d rather go home! To a country full of chickens and vampires! </strong>Yes. There’s just no pleasing some people, is there?</p> <p><strong>Do say: “</strong>Home is where the heart is.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: “</strong>Your home appears to be where the semi-electable bigots are.”</p>","headline":"How has Victor Spirescu – Romanian immigrant No 1 – got on in the UK?","trailText":"He arrived at Luton airport a year ago after a change in EU visa regulations, to be met by the press – and some apocalyptic warnings from Nigel Farage","newspaperPageNumber":"3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/2/1420216632133/Victor-Spirescu-shortly-a-004.jpg","wordcount":"404","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"454135424","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a6c86de4b084424a7b301f","internalOctopusCode":"9940612","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2217429","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-11T18:00:09Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2015/jan/04/victor-spirescu-immigration-nigel-farage","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2015/jan/04/victor-spirescu-immigration-nigel-farage","tags":[{"id":"uk/immigration","webTitle":"Immigration and asylum","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/immigration","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/immigration","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/series/pass-notes","webTitle":"Pass notes","description":"A quick chat designed to tell you everything you need to know about a story you don't need to know about","type":"series","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/series/pass-notes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/series/pass-notes","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/shortcuts","webTitle":"Shortcuts","description":"Our writers reflect on the people, issues and curiosities in the news","type":"blog","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/shortcuts","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"world/romania","webTitle":"Romania","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/romania","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/romania","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","webTitle":"Comment & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"aca7427868dd24165c36b33ce8b28e2e21b4c376","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/2/1420216638481/Victor-Spirescu-shortly-a-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/2/1420216638481/Victor-Spirescu-shortly-a-009.jpg","source":"Guardian","photographer":"Linda Nylind","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Victor Spirescu, shortly after arriving in the UK to a storm of media attention.","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Linda Nylind/Guardian","caption":"Victor Spirescu, shortly after arriving in the UK to a storm of media attention.

It’s all about pre-tirement these days, gradually reducing your hours until, at 95, you finally pack it in.</p> <p><strong>Who says? </strong>David Black, author of <a href=\"http://cdn.zopa.com/pressrelease/2014/zopa-ci-pretirement-report.pdf\">a new report based on a survey of 2,000 people aged between 50 and 80</a>. “Planning for, and moving towards, retirement is increasingly becoming a staggered process,” he says, “with use of the term ‘pre-tirement’ likely to become more widespread and understood in the years ahead.”</p> <p><strong>Staggered being the operative word. </strong>Indeed. Can we take a short break here while I have a lie down?</p> <p><strong>Are you feeling OK? </strong>Yes, thanks, much better. Let me just take a tablet. That’s better. Where were we?<br /></p> <p><strong>Staggering. </strong>Ah, yes. “Retirement is now rarely an event that you can plan to occur on a definite date years in advance,” says Black. “While some of us may be lucky enough to do so, for most of us there are too many variables.”</p> <p><strong>You mean we’re all broke? </strong>Yes, though of course the government likes to present pre-tirement as a chance to carry on leading a fulfilling working life until you die or, worse, enter a care home.</p> <p><strong>Tough on manual labourers. </strong>True, though oddly these surveys never seem to bother about them. The assumption is that everyone is a consultant of some sort, able to adjust their hours at will and physically capable of working more or less indefinitely.</p> <p><strong>When do you plan to stop?</strong> As soon as possible. It’s just a question of trying to get to the bottom of the column.</p> <p><strong>You can do it old chap, don’t despair.</strong> Thanks. This journalism game is so exhausting for us older folks.</p> <p><strong>Does the survey have any stats on the hours older employees work?</strong> It does indeed. The over-50s do 30 hours a week; the over-65s manage 20.</p> <p><strong>What a nightmare. </strong>Quite.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Will that do? I’m taking the afternoon off.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“But you’ve only worked two hours today.”</p>","headline":"What is pre-tirement?

What else should I be looking for? </strong>Have you ever seen your kids type “1174” on to the internet?</p> <p><strong>You know, I think I have. </strong>It means they’re planning a party at a secret location. Oh, and once they’re there, they’ll probably indulge in some heavy KOTL.</p> <p><strong>KOTL? </strong>Kissing on the lips. Then they’ll say “GYPO” (get your pants off), or “IWSN” (I want sex now) before indulging in their “DOC” (drug of choice).</p> <p><strong>That sounds terrif … wait a minute, drug of choice?</strong> Yes. Your definitely drug-addicted children definitely write “DOC” when they’re discussing the drugs they’re imminently about to take.</p> <p><strong>But my kid’s 13. Thirteen-year-olds don’t say “drug of choice”. That sounds like something a clueless middle-aged parent would make up. Did you hear this on an episode of Brass Eye? </strong>No, it’s from a recent CNN report entitled <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/08/living/internet-acronyms-every-parent-should-know/index.html?iref=allsearch\" title=\"\">28 Internet Acronyms Every Parent Should Know</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oh, I get it. This is one of these scaremongering reports designed to give kids a bad reputation and make you feel bad for being a shoddy parent. </strong>Fine, don’t believe me. Just don’t come crying to me when you discover your children 8ing all over the place.</p> <p><strong>I don’t know what that is.</strong> When a teenager types “8” on to the internet, it means they are requesting oral sex. Every single time! Even when they’re doing maths!</p> <p><strong>You’re being ridiculous. Goodbye. </strong>No, don’t go! LMIRL! That means “Let’s meet in real life”! I’m very lonely.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“LOL.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“IWSN.”</p>","headline":"Are your teenagers doing their best to KPC (keep parents clueless)?","trailText":"A new list of odd internet acronyms hints at the wild drug-fuelled sex romps your offspring might be indulging in.

It’s Mark Rylance, lauded thespian and star of the BBC’s forthcoming Wolf Hall adaptation. He’s the one dissatisfied by the size of his tacklebox.</p> <p><strong>Still, though. How unbecoming. </strong>There is a chance that Rylance wasn’t just idly boasting about the size of his penis. There might have been an element of historical accuracy involved, too.</p> <p><strong>So he was saying that his Wolf Hall codpiece had been deliberately toned down?</strong> Exactly that. He told journalists <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2014/12/wolf-hall-preview-damian-lewis-mark-rylance-bbc-masterpiece-1201320301/\" title=\"\">at the unveiling of the series in London this week</a>, “I think the codpieces are just too small. I think that was a directive from our American producers, PBS. They wanted smaller codpieces.”</p> <p><strong>Maybe they thought a giant protrusion jutting out of his groin would be a distraction.</strong> Maybe, but arguably that’s the whole point of a codpiece. Although they started out as a practical device for covering a gentleman’s modesty when he mounted a horse, by the time of Wolf Hall the codpiece had become a large and ornate thing. Just look at <a href=\"http://www.royalarmouries.org/line-of-kings/line-of-kings-objects/single-object/350\" title=\"\">the armour that Henry VIII used to wear</a>. He was practically a robot Bernie Clifton.</p> <p><strong>And this was all because Tudor men wanted everyone to know how big their genitals were?</strong> Possibly. There is another theory, however: some anthropologists believe that they might have actually been <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/codpiece-a-cover-up-for-syphilis\" title=\"\">used to contain venereal disease ointment</a>.</p> <p><strong>Great, so now when I watch Wolf Hall I’m going to be preoccupied by the thought of Mark Rylance’s manhood sliding around in a tunnel of Sudocrem.</strong> How you spend your leisure time has nothing to do with me.</p> <p><strong>Anyway, that’s the major take-home message about The BBC’s Wolf Hall, is it?</strong> Yes. Not that tax breaks allowed the series to be shot in England, or that it has been shot in documentary style, or that people think it’s good. It’s that an actor said something about willies.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Historical accuracy should not be compromised in the name of good taste.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “But let’s keep the scene where Henry VIII plays Candy Crush.”</p>","headline":"The BBC’s Wolf Hall adaptation: are the codpieces too small?","trailText":"Actor Mark Rylance has complained that his ‘tacklebox’ is not historically accurate.

It’s almost a thing but not quite. Moving on, we have Jessica Alba as Cash Money, thought to be a play on her husband Cash Warren’s name rather than an homage to the hip-hop DJ, Rob Schneider as Nazzo Good, Jude Law as Mr Perry, Daniel Craig as Olwen Williams (his grand-father’s name) and Clive Owen as Robert Fenton.</p> <p><strong>So, wait – who <em>IS</em> Johnny Madrid? </strong>Ah – that’s Tom Hanks. He also sometimes travels under the name of Harry Lauder.</p> <p><strong>Harry “I Love a Lassie” Lauder? The greatest Scottish singer and comedian in vaudeville history? </strong>The very same.</p> <p><strong>Oh, Tom Hanks. Just when I thought I couldn’t love you more, you know about Harry Lauder. </strong>I know. I know. Merry Christmas.</p> <p><strong>Do say: “</strong>I’m sure North Korea is not behind this hack. But let’s withdraw The Interview, the film about a CIA plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, as Pyongyang asked and see what happens.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “A minimally talented spoilt brat” of Angelina Jolie, as a leaked email from Hollywood producer Scott Rudin does.</p>","headline":"What are the aliases that Tom Hanks, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jessica Alba and Daniel Craig use to book

GO COMPARE! GO COMPAAAARE!</p> <p><strong>Make it stop! Everybody in Britain knows </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_-9QFvhQWo\"><strong>those annoying opera singer adverts!</strong></a><strong> </strong>Exactly. And now the business is worth £190m.</p> <p><strong>How come? </strong>Because the insurance company esure has just bought the half it didn’t own for £95m.</p> <p><strong>I’m starting to lose interest. </strong>GO COMPARE! GO COMPARE! GO COM-</p> <p><strong>All right! All right! I’m interested again! </strong>As well you should be. Because this is no ordinary insurance business acquisition.</p> <p><strong>That’s a relief. What is it instead? </strong>It’s Hayley Parsons’ crowning glory.</p> <p><strong>Who’s Hayley Parsons? </strong>She’s a 41-year-old Welsh entrepreneuse.</p> <p><strong>I see. </strong>She left school at 16 with five GCSEs, got a job making tea in an insurance office, then got a job selling insurance for Admiral, where she helped to set up confused.com. And it was at this point, in 2006, that she spotted a niche in the market for a Welsh insurance price and product comparison site with a name you could sing to the tune of an American first-world-war recruiting song.</p> <p><strong>Amazing. You’d think someone would have got there first. </strong>But no one had. So Parsons set up gocompare.com, which crucially let people compare policy details as well as prices, worked hard and made the company a huge success while her husband Mark quit his job to look after their two children. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-30386840\">She’ll get £44m for selling her stake in this deal</a>, on top of whatever else she’s already made.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me what her secret is without singing anything? </strong>“I think a lot of it comes down to attitude and personality,” she told <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/gocompare-hayleys-league-1942477\">Wales Online in 2010</a>. “I’m not afraid to go for something and do it … I meet so many people in business who just get stuck up their own backsides and that’s not me at all.”</p> <p><strong>So she’s not a shy, diffident character then? </strong>No indeed. Those adverts sound like a fair reflection of her style. She even insisted that they find a Welshman to play Gio Compario.</p> <p><strong>Dear God. He has a name? </strong>I’m afraid so. Although some people know him better as the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/9432262/Go-Compares-Gio-Compario-talks-money.html\">opera singer Wynne Evans</a>.</p> <p><strong>Not many people. </strong>No. probably not.</p> <p><strong>Do say: “</strong>Phew. I’ve finally got <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6hRDS3LvQQ\">that tune</a> out of my head.”</p> <p><strong>Please, I’m begging you, don’t say: “</strong>GO COMPARE!”</p>","headline":"Go Compare: can anyone compare to founder Hayley Parsons?","trailText":"The comparison website chief will bank £44m in a takeover deal.

</strong>Half-man, half-woman, all-compromise.</p><p><strong>Isn't merde a rude French word? </strong>It is. It's also a portmanteau of Merkel and Hollande, the old German chancellor and the new French president.</p><p><strong>So it's the new Merkozy? </strong>Exactly. But much less cosy than the old one.</p><p><strong>Because? </strong>Because unlike Mer and Kozy, Mer and&nbsp;De grew up on very different sides of the political tracks. She's an austerity-loving conservative and he's a stimulus-seeking socialist&nbsp;elected on the back of a pledge to renegotiate the eurozone's fiscal pact.</p><p><strong>Is that a problem? </strong>It is.</p><p><strong>Why so? </strong>Because Merkel insists that the fiscal pact is simply \"not up for debate\". She claims if they open up negotiations on the agreement, Greece will demand to renegotiate the troika package, other countries will follow suit and then everything that's ever been agreed in Europe since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia will have to be thrown out and rewritten from scratch. At which point every town, village and remote clifftop lighthouse in Europe will be simultaneously rendered worthless, ransacked by&nbsp;looters and set on fire.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a pretty intractable position she's got there. </strong>Nah, it's more flexible than it looks.</p><p><strong>Really? </strong>Yup. Hollande's off to see Merkel tomorrow afternoon as soon as he's been sworn in and experts reckon the pair should agree a compromise in no time.</p><p><strong>How exactly? </strong>By putting the fiscal pact to one side and putting together a \"growth pact\" to run alongside it, thus allowing both to walk away from discussions with their heads held high. The key question is whether the growth pact will be – as many supporters of Hollande are hoping – built around a fiscal stimulus funded by&nbsp;further borrowing, or – as Merkel's government is insisting it will have to be – a series of measures to&nbsp;improve European competitiveness.</p><p><strong>Hold on. Isn't \"measures to improve European competitiveness\" just another term for austerity? </strong>Pretty much, yep. That'd be why the French are saying \"Merde!\".</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"Merkel + Hollande = Merde ...\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"... so does Monti + Cameron = Moron?\"</p>","headline":"Pass notes, No 3,174: Merde","trailText":"<p>The only word for an uneasy compromise, soon to be found right at the very heart of the
